abstract = {Recently, several auction models with entry have been proposed: in one model (Levin and Smith, 1994, Li and Zheng, 2009), bidders are assumed to draw their private values after they decide to enter. In another model (Samuelson, 1985, Li and Zheng, 2009), bidders are assumed to learn their values before their entry decisions are made. The entry cost in the latter model can be interpreted as bid preparation cost, while the entry cost in the former model consists of both costs from information acquisition and bid preparation. Moreover, these two models have different implications for important policies, e.g., the optimal reserve price. In this paper we provide a unified structural framework where the two models can be estimated and distinguished using the Bayesian method. We apply our method to analyze Michigan timber sale auctions.}

abstract = {Background
Successful organ preservation is the premise for clinical organ transplantation. The present study investigated whether heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is important in the anti-apoptotic effect of diazoxide in hypothermic preservation rat hearts.
Methods
Isolated rat hearts were preserved in Celsior solution, with or without diazoxide, for 3 to 9 hours, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Cell apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxy uridine triphosphate nick-end labeling. The left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) was recorded. Expression of Hsp90 protein and cleavage of Bid were detected by Western blot and polymerase chain reaction.
Results
After hypothermic preservation for 3 to 9 hours, the LVDP recovery rate significantly decreased and cardiomyocyte apoptosis index increased in a time-dependent manner. When compared with the 9-hour preservation group, Celsior solution supplemented with diazoxide significantly enhanced the LVDP recovery rate and decreased the apoptosis index. The cleavage of Bid increased after 9 hours of hypothermic preservation, which was inhibited by Celsior solution supplemented with diazoxide. Hypothermic preservation of rat hearts for 9 hours decreased the expression of Hsp90, whereas diazoxide supplementation significantly increased the expression of Hsp90. The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin inhibited the diazoxide-induced decrease in cleavage of Bid, improvement of cardiac function, and decrease of apoptosis. Hsp90 inhibitor had no effect on the diazoxide-induced increase of total Cx43 protein expression in hearts preserved 9 hours, but inhibited the diazoxide-induced increase of mitochondrial Cx43 protein level.
Conclusion
Hsp90 might mediate diazoxide-induced cardioprotection against apoptosis in hypothermic preservation heart by preventing the cleavage of Bid.}

Some housing market experts advocate the supremacy of a jump bid, a significant bid increase to discourage fellow bidders, and thereby acquire the dwelling at a lower price compared to bidding strategy with moderate bid increases. We find no evidence for the efficacy of this jump bid strategy. Jump bidders, if successful, pay a positive jump premium. This also applies to the case where the jump is not the final bid and the jump bidder win at a later stage. In this case, the jump bid premium is around 1 to 2%. However, a jump bid is a credible signal of “serious intentions”. Jump bidders tend to win auction more often even in cases, where the jump bid is matched, and the auction continues.}

Using a sample of 169 transactions initiated by French listed firms over the period of 2000–2015, our findings provide evidence of i) a positive relationship between the control-ownership wedge of the ultimate controlling shareholder and target overpayment for non-family bidder firms, and ii) a negative impact of the presence of multiple large shareholders (MLS) on target overpayment. The bidding behavior is less pronounced in family-controlled firms. We show that the ultimate shareholders with excess control overpay for public targets when they hold more than 20% of the voting rights. The presence of MLS plays a crucial monitoring governance role by discouraging the ultimate owner from overpaying for targets. Overall, our findings contribute to the literature by examining the effect of controlling shareholder entrenchment on the acquisition premium in the presence of MLS. These findings are robust to a number of checks and have several policy implications.}

Thus, a method that does not take much time and can approximate a proper bid price can help a contractor in making bid-price decisions when the available bid-estimation time is insufficient. Such a method can also generate a target cost and provide a cross-check for their bid prices that were estimated using a detailed process. This study proposes a novel model for quickly making a bid-price estimation that integrates a probabilistic cost sub-model and a multi-factor evaluation sub-model. The cost sub-model, which is simulation-based, focuses on the cost divisions to save estimation time. At the same time, the multi-factor evaluation sub-model captures the specific factors affecting the cost of each cost division. The advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated by its application to three residential housing projects located in northern Taiwan. The steps for applying this model to other contractors are also provided.}

I propose a population criterion function that has a unique minimizer, which characterizes the utility function and density of private values. The resulting estimators emerge after replacing the population quantities by sample analogues. These estimators are uniformly consistent and their convergence rates are established. I further suggest an estimator for the optimal reserve price. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimators perform well in finite samples.}

Revenue maximization is achieved by an optimal allocation of assets across market segments, subject to constraints such as overbooking limit and the cross-elasticity of competitors’ pricing. Using a simulation model of a large hotel’s reservation system, validated by Marriott hotels, we find that the nested network method outperforms the bid price method, and, on average, leads to an improvement of 6% in revenue in the worst-case scenarios across operating environments. This improvement is 3.6% when restricted to cases in which overbooking and allocation are performed simultaneously. In no operating environment is the improvement less than 2%. Since the bid price method is, by far, the most commonly used allocation method in practice, these results indicate that hotels should consider switching to the nested network method. This change is feasible because (1) most hotels already have in place the core optimization system required to execute the nested network method, and (2) the nested network method converges to optimality in less than two minutes for most realistically sized problems, as we demonstrate.}

A rank-and-compare algorithm is considered to detect such anomalous bids and help auctioneers in achieving an effective rejection decision. Analytical expressions and simulation results are provided for the detection probability, as well as for the false alarm probability. The suggested range of application of the detection algorithm leaves out the cases of many tenderers (more than 20) and quite dispersed bids (coefficient of variation larger than 0.15). An increase in the number of tenderers leads to contrasting effects, since both the false alarm probability and the detection probability are reduced. If the bids are spread over a large range, we have instead a double negative effect, with more false alarms and less detections. The presence of multiple anomalous bids worsens the performance of the algorithm as well. On the other hand, the method is quite robust to the presence of courtesy bids.}

We first present some overall tendencies, including developments in number of bids per tender, contract size and cost developments. We use the cost implied by the winning bid as our cost indicator. The average cost per kilometre in the winning bid has increased substantially more than the general rate of inflation. At the same time, the average number of bidders per contract has fallen. Second, we build regression models to identify key drivers of cost developments in the bids. Contract sizes, in terms of vehicle-kilometres are found on average to be on the low side and an increase would reduce unit prices. We find as expected a significant effect of the number of bidders on unit prices. This leads us to a further investigation of factors explaining the number of bids per tender. We find that larger contracts tend to attract more bids, as do repeated tenders in the same area.}

While economic efficiency is expected to fall as a result of bid preferences, government procurement costs may either increase or decrease depending on the competitive response of favored and unfavored firms. This paper uses data from California auctions for road construction contracts, where small businesses receive a 5-percent bid preference in auctions for projects using only state funds and no preferential treatment on projects using federal aid. I show that while firms' bidding behavior matches theoretical predictions, procurement costs are 3.8 percent higher on auctions using preferences. The higher procurement cost in preference auctions is attributed to reduced participation by lower cost large firms. Structural estimates of latent firm costs are then used to evaluate how efficiency and the division of surplus between firms and the government are impacted by bid preferences. Firm profits are 3.1 percent lower under bid preferences, however this is overwhelmed by the efficiency loss due to reduced large firm participation. The efficiency loss conditional on firm participation is estimated to represent around 0.1 percent of overall procurement costs. Including the adverse effect of preferences on the participation of large firms increases the estimated efficiency loss to 3.6 percent, which represents 27 cents for each additional dollar awarded to small businesses through the program. Counterfactual simulations indicate that if participation were instead inelastic to bid preferences, the 5-percent bid preference would be close to the optimal level.}

However, the cooperative dimension covers the remaining dimensions. In fact, it ensures the consistency and the interaction between the different dimensions. We are not only interested in identifying the tools and applications needed to achieve a bid process, but we aim, also, at solving problems related to interactions intra, or even inter-applicative.

That is, HFT as a whole has a more neutral impact on the market’s volatility and bid-ask spread than the single aggressive and passive components. In fact, aggressive HFT has a consistent negative effect that increases, on average, both the volatility and bid-ask spread, whereas passive HFT displays a positive effect that decreases, on average, the volatility and bid-ask spread.}

It shows that bidders are selecting themselves; low-cost firms are more prone to enter the market. But they are more likely to be rejected for technical reasons. Procurement design, such as contract size, and public governance are also found important determinants of the entry strategy of firms.}

abstract = {The government sector is increasingly using competitive bidding for service deliveries such as the provision of bus and rail services as well as the purchasing of professional engineering services such as project planning, design, and project supervision. As part of a program to simplify and introduce consistency in the tender evaluation process, one government transport agency in New Zealand financed a study to investigate the potential of combined revealed and stated preference methods as a way of establishing weights to attach to the criteria used to evaluate offers of engineering services. These techniques have mainly been used in the study of travel choices; yet they have a much broader appeal in studying the decision making process of organisations. In this paper we use a data-mixing model to capture the decision expertise of a transport organisation through the revelation of preference weights for each evaluation criterion. Using choice information based on both market-driven and experimentally derived choice sets, we should be able to increase the robustness of the evaluation weights in comparison to the weights obtained from single data-sourced models. The resulting parameterised tool can be used in subsequent tender evaluations to provide an additional source of advice to supplement or replace that provided by current members of a bid evaluation team.}

abstract = {Prior studies suggest that income smoothing may be used as an earnings management tool by managers, and is associated with stock price declines when companies subsequently break smoothing patterns. We contend that investors' negative reaction in these situations is also driven by their magnified concerns about firm information risk, in addition to their decreased earnings expectations. Consistent with this argument, we find that bid-ask spreads around unexpected loss announcements are greater when preceded by higher levels of income smoothing. Furthermore, total spreads before the loss announcements were not greater for firms that exhibited higher income smoothing but had not reported earlier losses. This suggests that investors had difficulties seeing through managerial opportunistic motives before the unexpected loss announcements. Additionally, we find that institutional ownership and sell-side analyst coverage appear to moderate the positive association between income smoothing and bid-ask spreads, consistent with the monitoring role institutional investors and financial analysts play in constraining managerial opportunism. We also detect a significant decrease in the extent of income smoothing following loss announcements. Overall, our results are consistent with the view that income smoothing may be viewed by investors as being motivated by managerial opportunism instead of as communicating the true earnings results. Further analysis suggests that pursing a moderate amount of volatility in reported earnings may be the optimal financial reporting policy.}

abstract = {Objective
Hematopoietic regeneration is regulated by cell survival proteins, such as the Bcl-2 family. Bid, a BH3-only protein of the Bcl-2 family, has multiple cellular functions and is involved in a variety of physiological or pathological conditions. We attempted to define its role in hematopoietic cell repopulation under the stress condition of bone marrow transplantation.
Materials and Methods
We performed conventional or competitive bone marrow transplantation with donor hematopoietic cells from Bid−/− or Bid+/+ mice. Flow cytometry was used for quantification of hematopoietic stem cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and differentiated cells in different lineages (T, B, and myeloid cells). Single cell culture and homing assays were performed to further evaluate hematopoietic stem cell functions. Hematopoietic progenitor cells were also measured by the colony-forming cell culture.
Results
Contrary to the widely recognized role of Bid as a pro-apoptotic protein, the absence of Bid significantly reduced the reconstitution of donor hematopoietic cells in γ-irradiated recipients. Interestingly, however, numbers of hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells and their functions were not overtly altered. Instead, the regeneration of donor T and B cells was significantly impaired in the absence of Bid. Further analysis indicated an accumulation of the triple-negative T-cell population in the thymus, and pro-B cells in the bone marrow.
Conclusions
Our current study demonstrates a positive impact of Bid on hematopoietic regeneration mainly due to its unique effects on donor lymphopoiesis in the transplant recipients.}

A generalized Poisson model is used with a comprehensive data set containing most of the recently tendered bus contracts in Sweden, spanning the period 2007–2015. The main finding from the analysis is that most contract characteristics change participation in tenders by approximately 0.1–0.5 bidders. Operator-restricting measures such as special requirements on buses have a similar limited effect. Further, the number of tenders that are open at the same time as a specific tender was shown to reduce participation by almost two bidders. Finally, there is evidence that the local competitive environment is of importance, and the public transport authorities therefore need to be concerned with entry barriers in their tenders.}

Model results along with elasticity measurements summarize the effects of variation in shipping request and package, built environment, and socioeconomic characteristics. Third, we report the sensitivity of elasticities over different segmentations to understand whether and to what extent the supply responsiveness varies across segments. Our results show that (1) supply is unevenly distributed across the U.S. at the block group level, (2) this geographical disparity is a function of not only the shipping request and service characteristics, but also the socioeconomic and built-environment attributes, (3) the supply has denser pockets in areas with a higher percentage of African-American population, high wage workers, and families with two or more vehicles, (4) the supply peters off in areas with higher population and employment densities, while, it is accumulated in geographical areas with higher destination accessibility and regional employment diversity, and (5) the out-of-state and the business-to-customer shipments present the highest elasticity in receiving a bid, while posted requests with a delivery deadline is the most inelastic segment. Transportation planners and crowd-shipping companies can use these results to implement improved supply creation, geographically targeted growth, and price discrimination strategies.}

As well as other types of infrastructure, the roads infrastructure requires a proper procurement process. The research shows that prices presented in public bids are lower than those expected by contracting authorities. Public owners are restricted to the public bidding procedures, especially the provision to use low bid price in the Public Procurement Act. Often a public owner has concerns about the contractor bidding with the lowest sum. Contractors are repeatedly requested to explain the reasons for their low price. This leads to time extension of the bid process. The lack of contracts for construction work and an additional competitive concern to win out in the bid process may be the reason for low prices. An incorrect calculation of the estimated contract price by the contracting authority itself could be another reason. The cost analysis of two sections of highway clearly showed incorrect cost estimates by the relevant contracting authority. The difference was primarily due to significantly lower rates of indirect costs and profit, rebates granted when buying building materials, and lower cost of plant. The author summarizes the possible causes of the incorrect estimates of expected value and at the same time proposes methods to achieve better estimates for the contract price. The public sector may use the results of this study to identify the ineffectiveness of procurement in the area of infrastructure projects in the Czech Republic. The proposed procedures should improve the efficiency of procurement and provide better cost estimates by the public agencies.}

The resulting non-linear bilevel optimization problem is transformed into a single-level stochastic bilinear program using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the lower-level Independent System Operator dispatch problem. By discretizing the offers and bids of the merchant storage owner, the problem is formulated as a stochastic disjunctive program. Using the disjunctive nature of the derived program, a specialized branch-and-bound algorithm that applies a linear quasi-relaxation of the merchant storage problem is proposed. Our solution algorithm is able to solve the problem in an efficient manner; returning the charge and discharge strategies for the merchant storage owner that yield the highest expected profits. Simulations of test systems reveal the various abilities of the merchant storage owner to exercise unilateral market power. Those include demand withholding, generation withholding and under-use which result in an increased congestion in both space and time when compared to the welfare-maximizing use of storage. Factors such as uncertain bids by other players, final state-of-charge requirements and arbitrage by other storage players are investigated. Moreover, numerical results demonstrate the superior computational performance of the proposed solution algorithm when benchmarked against current practices in the literature.}

The auction network contributes significantly to models of price dynamics and the network predicts final sales prices better than economic (non-network) indicators alone. In addition, network analyses are useful in identifying the key bidders whose actions seem to exert disproportionate influence on other bidders and the final sales prices. Furthermore, the key bidders may be identified very early in an auction process, which has practical implications for the auction house managers and for other bidders.}

We conceptualize the bidding system and use an instrumental variable approach to study the effect of benchmark changes on bids. We use 2006–2010 plan payment data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, published county benchmarks, actual realized fee-for-service costs, and Medicare Advantage enrollment. We find that a $1 increase in the benchmark leads to about a $0.53 increase in bids, suggesting that plans in the Medicare Advantage market have meaningful market power.}

Using a daily data set, we find that order flows are inadequate when it comes to explaining the changes in the low trading density currencies. Alternatively, within the high trading density, both order flows and bid–ask spreads significantly affect the foreign exchange rate returns. Our findings suggest that the order flow model is better at incorporating these microstructure effects except for some currencies with a very high level of trading density.}

abstract = {As a hazardous volatile organic compound (VOC), formaldehyde (FA) is found ubiquitously in both polluted and unpolluted environments. Hence, for the proper control of FA, techniques for rapid and precise quantitation of FA are in great demand. However, because of its low molecular weight and high reactivity, its quantitation generally requires complicated procedures (such as combination of sampling through 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatization and detection through high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC)). Such an approach, despite proven reliability, is inefficient for fast tracking of FA level under dynamic conditions. To overcome such limitations and to facilitate the near real-time monitoring of gaseous FA, we developed an alternative detection method based on a gas chromatograph/barrier discharge ionization detector interfaced with a large-volume injection system (LVI/GC/BID). The reliability of lab-made gaseous standards of formaldehyde was investigated based on thermal cracking of paraformaldehyde. The developed LVI/GC/BID approach allowed the detection of gaseous FA with a method detection limit (MDL) of about 0.13 ng (0.21 ppm for 0.5 mL sample) over the linear dynamic range of 0.29–5300 ng with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.19% compared with the direct injection-based GC/BID MDL of 2.41 ng (6.56 ppm for 0.3 mL sample) and RSD of 3.35%.}

Analysts also respond to these forecasts by revising their forecasts for the bidder upward. However, the benefits of forecast disclosure only accrue to bidders with a strong forecasting reputation prior to the acquisition. Explaining why not all bidders forecast, we document a higher likelihood of post-merger litigation and CEO turnover for bidders with a weak forecasting reputation and for those that underperform post-merger.}

The attributes of the auctioned objects are usually divided into two groups: technical and business attributes. They are reviewed and scored by technical and business experts who act as referees in the bid evaluation process. To analyze their bid evaluation behavior, we built a model for a multi-attribute reverse auction. With correlations between the bid evaluations of the different referee groups across the attributes, the bid evaluation problem is not the usual multi-attribute decision-making problem. We assess the cause–effect relationship that is present, and show that antagonism between referee groups tends to grow over time. We tested how this works with data from simulated auctions. To diminish the potential for antagonism between the two referee groups, we propose a modified bid evaluation mechanism. We also conducted role-playing experiments involving the referee behaviors as a means for assessing the proposed mechanism. Our results suggest that the modified bid evaluation mechanism is beneficial.}

Other literatures have concluded that, when stock prices are high and rising, M&A is higher, more M&A is financed with stock, market sentiment and stockholders’ perceptions of information appear to change, and in these circumstances new (arbitrage) motivations for M&A emerge. This paper revisits earnings management ahead of M&A in the light of these findings, comparing experience in ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ markets. It finds that such earnings management is more pronounced in hot markets; that only in such markets are positive discretionary accruals commonly associated with positive abnormal returns on the announcement of earnings; and that in such markets – against the expectations from signalling theory – these positive returns are not reversed on announcement of a stock-for-stock bid. The results suggest that the economic benefits achieved by engaging in earnings management during hot markets are indeed significant: in hot markets, we estimate that on average share acquirers engage in working capital accrual management equivalent to over a third of the average acquirer’s return on total assets in that year; and that this earnings management is associated with increases in market value which are statistically and economically significant, enabling the bidder to secure control of the target with fewer shares.}

We find evidence that bidder's cumulative announcement returns (CARs) are lower when they acquire family controlled targets compared to non-family controlled targets. We show that this result holds regardless of whether the deal is paid with shares or cash and whether or not the bidding firm is also privately owned. Moreover, the result is independent of the size of the acquisition relative to the size of the acquiring firm. Our findings are consistent with the notion that the bidder has to pay a higher price in order to convince the family owners to sell in return for giving up private benefits.}

This paper argues that holding a toehold makes hostile bidders more likely to withdraw from the contest if another bidder enters. The evidence is consistent with our hypothesis: hostile bidders that have a toehold, on average, earn significant abnormal returns of 4.98%, with a mean toehold of 13.81%. Those without a toehold, on average, earn a significantly lower 0.06% return.}

My model also explains the correlation between announcement returns and firm characteristics, as well as the low predictability of mergers.}

Using a sample of 275 intra-European public acquisitions initiated between 2003 and 2010, we find target firm shareholders to earn significantly positive bid premiums in both domestic and cross-border acquisitions. However, these premiums are substantially greater, approximately 8% greater, in cross-border than in domestic acquisitions. When the method of payment is considered, the bid premiums are found to be much larger for stock than cash offers. Our empirical results are in line with those for the US takeover market. Previous M&A literature reports that the difference in bid premiums between cross-border and domestic acquisitions can be explained by variations in corporate governance structures. Our analysis of the European takeover market shows that the cross-border effect in target bid premiums is decreasing with the increased quality of corporate governance/investor protection in the bidding firm. However, no evidence exists that this effect is more pronounced in deals completed with stock. Finally, we provide new arguments in support of the hypothesis that there is significant difference in abnormal returns to targets and bidders depending on their location − Continental Europe or the UK/Ireland.}

The proposed model minimizes financing cost, reduces the bid price, enhances the competitiveness of the bidder, increases the contractor`s negotiating power with a lender by providing an optimum financing schedule, and eliminates the risk of financing surprises during construction.

We also observe that high-quality bidders are more likely to withdraw from bidding because of their prior commitment to quality. The procurers who use quality indicators in price auctions need a carefully considered quality threshold. Our results have important implications for price-quality trade-offs in procurements that have uncertain quality thresholds.}

The selection of qualified construction contractor has been generally formulated and addressed as a multi-attribute group decision-making problem. However, few existing studies have taken the reasoning logic pattern in human cognition process and the compensatory among attributes into account. Therefore, a two-stage logic scoring of preference-ELECTRE III-based approach is established for the management and manipulation of bidder selection. In a bid to facilitate expert evaluation articulation, alternative-attribute assessments in this approach take the form of generalized comparative linguistic expressions, which are subsequently converted into possibility-distribution-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set via the similarity measure-based generation approach to enhance information quality and reliability. Then, nonlinear optimization-based direction rules are introduced to advance the automatic minimum-distance-based consensus reaching model and based on which, the individual semantic-embedded assessments are algorithmically adjusted to reach acceptable consensus. Furthermore, the expert and attribute importance degrees are extracted from both semantic and formal logic aspects, and the modified individual assessments are gathered by integrating the two-stage logic scoring of preference aggregation structure and the ELECTRE III method. The present approach provides a solution to bid evaluation problems considering the reasoning logic pattern in human cognition process and the compensatory among attributes. A practical case study and a comparative analysis are performed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the established multi-attribute group decision-making approach.}

abstract = {Green construction is to conserve the resources and reduce the negative impact of construction activities on the environment to the maximum extent, with scientific management and technological progress under the premise of ensuring the quality, safety and other basic requirements. Recent years, accompanied by the rapid development of construction industry, a considerable proportion of energy and resources, particularly high-carbon materials, is consumed in the construction activities, emitting mass greenhouse gases, which have a damaging impact on the environment. This is especially for the mega public projects. Therefore, under the green and sustainable perspective, actions to control carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the construction industry are imperative. In this case, if CO2 emissions reduction can be considered beforehand during the bid evaluation stage, contractors will be guided by bid evaluation indicators and therefore improve their construction schemes, enabling the construction phase to be green, energy saving and sustainable. This is because bid evaluation indicators can serve as guiding effect on the contractors. Given that CO2 emissions are rarely given sufficient consideration in traditional bid evaluation, this study conducts a systematic analysis to identify major sources of CO2 in construction phase and attempts to develop a conceptual computational model in terms of CO2 emission. Then, a linguistic group decision-making framework for bid evaluation in mega public projects considering CO2 emissions reduction is developed. In this framework, entropy, relative entropy, the standard deviation method and weighted aggregation operators are applied to determine the indicator weights, the expert weights and the information aggregation in bid evaluation decision-making. Finally, a scenario comparison between the proposed linguistic group decision-making bid evaluation framework and the traditional framework is made through a case study, and the scientific basis and reliability of this new framework are validated. The establishment of this framework can enrich the decision-making methods in construction management field. And it can provide meaningful reference for owners to choose the most qualified contractors and spur contractors to improve their construction schemes, enabling construction phase to be green, energy saving and sustainable.}

Contractors often use an all-in rate to lump overhead and markup together on top of direct cost for arriving at a bid price. Such a method is naturally prone to inaccuracy and involves a greater risk in competitive bidding, if the applied rate is selected subjectively. The present research aims to develop an improved approach to determining the combined rate of overhead and markup in the bid price for a project. Four factors, i.e., direct cost, duration, type of work, and location, were used as inputs to build a regression model from cost and bid data of collected projects for predicting the overhead and markup rate in the winning bid for a project, which, together with the model error, is used to estimate the probability of winning for a bid level. Then, based on minimization of overall loss risk proposed by a previous research, the bid preventing over-cuts in price competition is determined by using the model, the probabilistic estimates of project cost, and the probability of recovering costs if losing the bid. The approach is illustrated using two cases and the suggested bids for the cases are compared with those from other models.}

The popularity had five determinants: (i) a morning-market factor, the relative interest-rate changes in the morning for the 10-year maturity length compared to 5 to 9-year maturity lengths, (ii) a volatility factor, the relative volatility of 10-year interest rates compared to the other maturity lengths, (iii) a yield-curve factor, the relative value of 10-year interest rates compared to 7-year ones, (iv) a market-liquidity factor, the relative liquidity level for current 10-year government bonds compared to those with 7-year remaining maturity, and (v) a scarcity factor, the size of the auctions relative to the amount of marketable government bonds in the 9 to 10-year maturity segment. The popularity also co-integrated with the five factors, amongst which the yield-curve factor was the most powerful in explaining the popularity’s long-term equilibria. It took three auctions for the popularity to reach a new equilibrium, after diverting by five percentage points from its long-term equilibrium. The morning-market factor was the greatest source of unexpected changes in the popularity.}

Other elements include a wallet estimator, which gauges the bidders’ willingness to pay, and a bid strategizer, which embeds the forecasting model into a fully automated decision system. We illustrate the performance of our intelligent bidding system on an authentic dataset of online art auctions for Indian contemporary art. We compare our system with several simpler ad-hoc approaches, and find it to be more effective in terms of both the extracted surplus and the resulting winning percentage.}

The positive difference in premiums between strategic and financial acquirers is driven by the difference in dispersions of valuations (e.g., strategic bidders’ synergies are more dispersed) and the set of auction participants. The difference in average valuations is relatively unimportant. My approach can help explain outcomes of asset sales, even in settings with limited bidder data.}

Based on 39,260 firm-year observations, we find, consistent with behavioural consistency theory, that conservative bidders are less likely to engage in M&A deals. Further, those that decide to engage in M&As are likely to acquire public targets and within-industry firms. These bidders are inclined to employ more stock acquisitions than cash acquisitions. Our results also indicate that conservative bidders experience abnormally poor stock returns around the announcements of M&A investments. This provides new insights on the mechanism through which bidders' sentiments influence shareholders' wealth. Overall, these findings highlight the implications of the textual sentiment of corporate disclosure for the forecasting of corporate investment and financing decisions. Our results have practical implications, since they shed light on the value relevance of the information content of major Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)-mandated 10-K filings.}

This chapter describes the various specifications for pipe, material, and certain equipment used in pipeline and facilities construction. It also provides an overview construction specifications. In addition, it discusses material requisition development and deals with a general guideline for bid analysis. The single most important reason for writing clear and precise specifications is to ensure that the vendors or contractors, engineers, and bidders are well informed enough to provide the final product required that results in quality without additional work or modifications resulting from poorly executed specifications. The specifications should be authoritative, not restraining. The objective of writing specifications is to explain to the suppliers of material or services what is required to achieve the final product. If there is insufficient data and detail to support the final goal, the bidder may be confused. This results in a product or service that does not satisfy the objective. Simultaneously, the specifications should not be too detailed in manners that restrict the bidders needlessly. It is important that as many bids as possible are received to improve competition and increase the chances of purchasing equipment or services that meets the requirements at the best possible price. Therefore, specifications must be detailed enough to leave no question in the bidders' mind as to what is required, but should be generic enough to allow multiple manufacturers' equipment to be offered.}

The model effectively evaluates alternative bids based on the ideal targets set by the buyer. The alternative bid ratings are then utilized in an integer programming model in selecting an optimal set of bids that satisfy the buyer's demand requirements. The model also assists in proposing effective negotiation strategies for unselected bids in order to make them competitive. Finally, the paper proposes four variations of the model for evaluating different bid scenarios thereby providing flexibility for the buyer in selecting the appropriate method.

Quantitative evaluations are introduced to set the likely chance of a claim occurrence, to manage the claim success and to expect a negotiation offer ratio for the profit in claim negotiation.

This article examines how the interface used for bid elicitation affects bidding behavior and, ultimately, retailer profit. Our focus is on one key aspect of the bid-elicitation interface – how retailers require bidders to articulate their bids. Evidence from four experiments involving economically consequential bids demonstrates that the candidate bid amounts specified by the retailer have a strong influence on bidding behavior, and consequently also on retailer profit. In particular, the level of candidate bid amounts has a positive effect on actual bid amounts, whereas it has a negative impact on the likelihood that a consumer will actually submit a bid. Critically, we show that the former effect can more than offset the latter to cause an increase in retailer profit. We propose and find support for two distinct pathways driving this phenomenon – the candidate bid amounts (1) influence bidders’ valuations of the offered product and (2) shape bidders’ beliefs about what bid amounts will be successful. Our results highlight the importance of the design of user interfaces for interactive pricing, demonstrating that even seemingly innocuous aspects of interfaces can have a dramatic impact on bidding behavior and retailer profit.}

These structures are modeled using network analyses, which enables: (1) a richer understanding of detailed auction processes, both within auctions and across auctions of multiple lots, (2) a mapping of the processes to the forecast of prices and the trajectory toward final sales prices, (3) the clear and early identification of key bidders who are influential to the bidding action and who impact final auction sales prices, and (4) the results clearly show that the network exchange patterns are significant and contribute to an understanding of auction processes and outcomes above and beyond simple economic predictors such as the number of bids or bidders or the bidders’ economic status.

abstract = {Background:
Inhaled beta2-agonists are widely used in asthma treatment. The design limitations of pressurizedmetered dose inhalers (pMDIs) have prompted the development of dry powder inhalers (DPIs) for the delivery of asthma medications.
Objective:
The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and effect on asthma-related quality of life (QOL) of a long-acting beta2-adrenoreceptor agonist, formoterol, delivered via multidose DPI, compared with albuterol delivered via pMDI or placebo in adolescents and adults with persistent asthma.
Methods:
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-groupstudy was conducted in outpatient clinics at 18 US centers. Adolescents and adults with persistent asthma received formoterol 10 pg BID via multidose DPI, albuterol 180 μg QID via pMDI, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the 12-hour AUC of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after 12 weeks treatment. Secondary efficacy variables included asthma-related QOL, asthma symptom scores, rescue medication use, and other pulmonary function measures.
Results:
A total of 239 patients (147 females, 92 males; age range, 13–85 years) with persistent asthma were enrolled (formoterol, n = 80; albuterol, n = 79; placebo, n = 80). Formoterol delivered via the multidose DPI resulted in clinically relevant and statistically significant increases in 12-hour AUC of FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment compared with albuterol pMDI and placebo (P < 0.019 and P < 0.001, respectively). Asthma-related QOL (total score) was significantly improved with formoterol treatment compared with placebo (P < 0.015). Nocturnal asthma symptom scores significantly improved with formoterol compared with albuterol and placebo (P < 0.001 and P < 0.003, respectively) and rescue medication use was significantly less with formoterol compared with albuterol and placebo (P < 0.004 and P < 0.002, respectively). Treatment with formoterol was well tolerated.
Conclusions:
In this study of adolescents and adults with persistent asthma, 12 weeks of treatment with formoterol 10 μg BID delivered via a multidose DPI provided significantly greater 24-hour bronchodilation compared with albuterol and placebo and resulted in significant improvements in asthma-related QOL compared with placebo. Formoterol was well tolerated in these patients.}

An increasing number of countries have adopted auctions for the allocation of permits and financial support for renewable energy projects, thereby increasing competition among project developers. As a result, profit margins have decreased significantly while sensitivity to risks and uncertainty has increased. The adequate quantification of bid prices is a key challenge. We present a modeling approach to determine competitive and risk-adequate auction bids. The contribution of this paper is an improved method for quantifying marginal cost, which is the minimum sales price per unit of electricity through which the investment criteria of all project stakeholders are fulfilled. In our financial model, the risk-adequateness is determined through the investment criteria of equity investors by means of the adjusted present value, and those of debt investors by means of the debt service cover ratio, through Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting marginal cost serve as the starting point for strategic bidding optimization, regardless of the pricing rule in the contemplated auction design. To demonstrate the integrability of our mathematical model with strategic bidding optimization, we check its applicability in a case study, which shows how a German project developer should bid to realize an onshore wind farm project. We show that our model enables the quantification of bid prices that are both competitive and risk-adequate.}

In the proposed model, the lowest bid is assessed according to the unit prices electronically obtained from the owner and all qualified bidders. Moreover, a differential ratio is defined to measure the deviation between the unit prices submitted by both the owner and the lowest bidder. The merits of this innovative model are demonstrated by applying it to two subprojects of a building construction project.

abstract = {The South African government has had a nearly 17 year moratorium on new commuter bus contracts. In late 2017, the government lifted this moratorium which enabled the Gauteng Provincial Government to design a service for a number of operating areas, one of which was for the Mamelodi township to the east of Pretoria.From the outset, some operators expressed their reservations about the quality of the supporting information, especially the lack of detailed passenger and route information, and the lack of an escalation formula for the seven year contract. Bidders viewed these aspects as major cost risks that made it difficult to determine a competitive price for the service.The purpose of the research is to investigate how bidding companies viewed the Mamelodi contract when tendering for the service and to compare the results of the bidding process amongst the respective bidders. To achieve this objective a single case study strategy was followed. Use was made of a structured questionnaire to interview the bidding companies, documentary analysis such as the detailed specifications of the Mamelodi contract as well as obtaining financial and operating information from the bidding companies that could serve as a basis of comparison on how the companies responded to the tender requirements. These sources of information were triangulated to arrive at observations and conclusions.The results of the research indicated that there were major variances in annual passenger trip estimates, passenger revenue estimates, subsidy requirements and overall tender amounts, amongst the bidders. This is mainly as a result of incomplete passenger information and a lack of detailed route information, the lack of an adequate escalation formula and a requirement that bidders had to sub-contract 30% of their services to smaller operators. The higher costs for the service, compared to the cost of the incumbent operator, resulted in the tender not being awarded.Recommendations are that contracting authorities ought to supply as much information as possible in the design of public transport contracts in order to receive truly cost competitive bids. This ought to include detailed passenger numbers and related passenger fares (to determine overall revenue) and detailed route and network kilometres so that the bidders can determine their operating costs. In addition, contracts ought to include adequate escalation formulae (especially the correct weighting of cost elements) and where there are special requirements, such as sub-contracting of services, that such requirements can be reasonably executed by bidders.}

In our present time, it is not unusual for financial transactions to take place virtually with nothing more than a computer and a credit card; many times without ever having to engage face-to-face with another person. Part of these electronic transactions taking place day-to-day are not simple economic mechanisms, instead they are constructed in the form of auctions in which a key aspect is the protection of bidders. Ideally, electronic auction mechanisms should provide the following fundamental properties: privacy of the losing bids, robustness, verifiability, and non-repudiation. This can only be accomplished by proper sealed-bid auction protocols. Indeed, the main motivation for constructing sealed-bid auction protocols is the fact that auctioneers and/or sellers may use the past losing bids to maximize their revenues in future auctions and negotiations. In addition, private valuations can be used to disclose personal preferences and private information about the bidders. This paper therefore surveys existing cryptographic solutions that are used for electronic sealed-bid auction protocols, and provides the challenges that currently exist in this field. Overall, various technical approaches will be covered and the state-of-the-art will be reviewed thoroughly.}

Substitution and partial fulfillment options are presented in formulations to allow bidders with fewer inventories to offer substitute item types and partial bids in auctions. During the auction announcement phase, a coordinating platform for disaster locations (i.e., auctioneer) allows substitution and partial fulfillment options to the relief suppliers (i.e., bidders) when acceptable. Thus, suppliers with fewer inventories can offer substitute item types and participate in more auctions by partially bidding. A genetic algorithm, a simulated annealing algorithm and an integer program are used for the analysis of the bid construction phase with different announcement options. Heuristic solution techniques and an IP formulation help understand the dynamics of the bid construction problem. It is shown that the addition of substitution and partial fulfillment options is essential to diversify and increase the usable capacity of the supplier base. Additionally, the partial fulfillment option enables better usage of supplier inventories in an environment with scarce supplies.}

Controlling for project characteristics, for observed and unobserved heterogeneity at municipality level, our main results suggest that projects that are more complex are more likely to be procured with negotiated procedures. On average, a rise in the project complexity index from the 25th to the 75th percentile of its distribution increases the probability of procuring the project with a negotiated procedure by about 6%–8%. However, our results also suggest that the impact of complexity might be more relevant in the case of projects procured by municipalities located in provinces characterized by low levels of corruption. Moreover, we also find that complex projects are associated to longer delays in their execution, larger rebates and to higher probabilities to be awarded to local firms.}

We reach this conclusion based on the parametric effect determined by the sign and the magnitude of the coefficients associated with the trading intensity variables, the trading effect determined by the ratio of transitory effects to permanent effects, and the economic effect determined by the size of the implicit bid–ask spread. While we find that the implicit bid–ask spread and transitory effects are decreasing toward the end of the trading day in consistency with information models in the literature, there is a surge of trades at the market close, most probably due to information uncertainty at market opening in New York.}

One of the most powerful and simple approaches to address this issue consists of assigning threshold values (“bid prices”) to each resource, and to accept requests whenever their revenue exceeds the sum of the bid prices associated with its constituent resources. In this context, we propose a new customer choice-based mathematical program to estimate time-dependent bid prices. In contrast with most approaches from the current literature, ours is characterized by its flexibility. Indeed, it can easily embed technical and practical constraints that occur in most central reservation systems (CRS). To solve the model, we develop a column generation algorithm, in which the NP-hard subproblem is addressed via an efficient heuristic procedure. Our computational results illustrate the performance of the method, through comparisons with alternative proposals.}

The rapid development of the online auction market has lead scholars to call for more research into the factors that influence the results of such auctions and how they are related to consumers’ online bidding behavior. To this end, the current study designs a lab environment and mainly explores the influences of the start bidding price (US$0.33 versus US$60), the number of bidders and promotion programs (low price versus quality) on the results of online auctions of hotel coupons. The research results indicate the following market dynamics. (1) Regardless of whether there is a low or high start-bidding price, more bidders lead to higher end-prices, especially with high start-bidding prices. (2) When a seller provides a higher start-bidding price, the end-prices will be higher. (3) Different promotion programs result in different end-prices, especially when the product characteristics are integrated effectively with such programs. When hotel coupons are the main auction product, they are associated with high-quality leisure and lifestyle factors, thus indicating that the integration of high accommodation quality with quality promotion programs can attract consumers to join the bidding process and lead to higher end-prices. (4) Regardless of whether there is a low or high start-bidding price, winners will always report higher ratings regarding distributive fairness, procedural fairness and information fairness than will losers. The research results have important theoretical and practical implications, which are discussed in the conclusions.}

We concentrate on the nature (fixed or floating) of bid-ask spreads (hereafter ‘spread’) and demonstrate that the effectiveness of an automated trading system more significantly degrades in the case of floating spreads compared to fixed spreads. We investigate four fixed spreads (one, two, five and ten pips) and a floating spread with a median value of two pips and demonstrate that the floating spread with a mean value of 0.02 USD results in significantly worse performance than a fixed spread of 0.1 USD. ‘Floating spreads’ in this paper is a term used for market-determined continuously changing bid-ask spreads.}

We assume that orders submitted by low-frequency traders (LFTs) and news events arrive at the market with Poisson processes. Additionally, our model supports the trading of the two-sided quote in one period. We find that more LFTs and a higher exchange latency both hurt market liquidity. The HFT prefers to choose a two-sided quote to gain more profits while cautiously chooses a one-sided quote during times of high volatility. The model generates some testable implications with supporting empirical evidence from the NASDAQ-OMX Nordic Market.}

Using a sample of hyperactive bidders, I show that managerial excessive acquisitiveness can precipitate firm exit. Overbidding is associated with weak corporate governance and lower disclosure quality within firms. I find that hyperactive bidders take more risk compared to conservative bidders. Such bidders also misallocate firms’ resources and dent firms’ reputational capital. Eventually, the external corporate control market is more effective compared to mechanisms such as bankruptcy reorganization, forced liquidation, leveraged buy-out, and expulsion from stock exchanges in disciplining hyperactive bidders by turning them into targets of takeover. These results suggest that a hyper acquisition-induced growth strategy is, on average, detrimental to the long-term survivability of firms and that the internal and external corporate-control mechanisms may not be effective enough to forestall falling value of an excessively acquisitive firm.}

Specifically, due to the improper keyword bidding, many advertisers cannot survive the competitive ad auctions to get their desired ad impressions; meanwhile, a significant portion of search queries have no ads displayed in their search result pages, even if many of them have commercial values. We propose recommending a group of relevant yet less-competitive keywords to an advertiser. Hence, the advertiser can get the chance to win some (originally empty) ad slots and accumulate a number of impressions. At the same time, the revenue of the search engine can also be boosted since many empty ad shots are filled. Mathematically, we model the problem as a mixed integer programming problem, which maximizes the advertiser revenue and the relevance of the recommended keywords, while minimizing the keyword competitiveness, subject to the bid and budget constraints. By solving the problem, we can offer an optimal group of keywords and their optimal bid prices to an advertiser. Simulation results have shown the proposed method is highly effective in increasing ad impressions, expected clicks, advertiser revenue, and search engine revenue.}

Both aspects are believed to elicit an exciting shopping experience, which may culminate in auction fever. In two laboratory experiments, we investigate the process of auction fever in retail auctions and demonstrate when and how auction fever affects bidding behavior. In contrast to previous studies, we employ physiological measurements as an objective and continuous assessment of bidders’ arousal in addition to a subjective assessment of bidders’ emotions through psychometric scales. Moreover, we explicitly study the interaction of time pressure and social competition on arousal and bids. We find that bidders’ arousal is increased in high time pressure auctions and that this leads to higher bids in ascending auctions—but only when bidders compete with human opponents. Thus, social competition is the actual driver underlying the auction fever phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that the “joy of winning” is significantly stronger than the “frustration of losing” in ascending auctions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the design of retail auctions.}

Bidders need to feel safe about the reliability of the seller for placing bids on an auction. Seller’s characteristics could affect the evaluation and the deal of the online auctions. This study employs collected eBay data set to analyze the effects of factors, bidders’ and sellers’ characteristics on the final price and the duration of the auction. Important factors are recognized by a probit model. Seller’s items for sale (SIFS), bidder’s lifetime positive feedback (BLPF), and seller’s lifetime positive feedback (SLPF) are the most important factors identified by the probit analysis. Furthermore, impacts of important factors and their interactions are studied by factorial design approach. The results of the study reveal that SLPF plays a major role in affecting the final price (51.2%) and both SIFS and BLPF are the critical roles (20.1% and 28.1%, respectively). Furthermore, the interaction of BLPF and SLPF also are important to affect the final price (4.5%). Consequently, the final price heavily depends on the bidder and seller ratings. For the duration of the auction, SLPF explains most of the variations (62.8%). Seller’s reputation is decisive no matter in performance on the duration of the auction or final price.}

Within this novel methodology a bidder is considered to follow a Bayes-strategy. Thereby, one bidder is assumed to behave strategically and the behavior of the remaining is summarized in a probability distribution of the market price and a reaction function to price dumping by the strategic bidder. With this approach two problems arise: First, as a pay-as-bid auction is considered, no uniform price and therefore no single probability distribution of the market price is readily available. Second, if historic bidding data of all participants are used to estimate such a distribution and market power is a relevant factor, the bid of the strategically behaving bidder is likely to influence the distribution. Within this paper for both of the problems solutions are presented. It is shown that by estimating a probability of acceptance the optimal bidding price with respect to a given capacity can be calculated by maximizing a stochastic non-linear objective function of expected profit. Taking the characteristics of recently established markets in Germany into account, the methodology is applied using exemplary data. It is shown that the methodology helps to manage existing price uncertainties and hence supports the trading decisions of a bidder. It is inferred that the developed methodology may also be used for bidding on other auction markets with a similar market design.}

abstract = {Currently, it is critical to nurture bidder loyalty in the highly competitive online auction business. This study investigated the mediating effect of consumer perceptions between technological/brand stimuli and bidder loyalty to an online auction website by applying the traditional and evolutionary stimulus–organism–response models. We tested these models using 449 bidders from Taobao, an online auction service provider in China. Based on the results of covariance-based structural equation modelling, we showed that consumer perceptions fully mediate technological stimuli, but only partially mediate brand stimuli, and bidder loyalty. These results can be used to further improve the related research and practice.}

Considering the content of the construction project bid evaluation, an appraisal index system of the construction project bid evaluation was established; The reasonable range of index values which can reflect the tenderer preference was utilized to perform standardization of evaluation indicators; The optimal grey relational grades for bidder were determined by gray relational model, and the optimal decision-making conclusion for bid evaluation was made after comparison of the optimal grey relational grades. The model had the advantages of complementary of theory and experience, strong operability and scientific quantify, therefore popularized the grey correlation model application in construction project.}

Although these new tools (such as iso-Score Curve Graphs, Scoring Probability Graphs, and Position Probability Graphs) are designed for bidders in capped tendering (tenders with an upper price limit), some of their principles can also be applied by a Contracting Authority to detect which bidders do not follow a standard pattern, that is, their bids are extremely high or low. Since a collusive bid generally needs to be sufficiently high or low to make an impact on the bid distribution, any person in charge of supervising capped tenders can be alerted to any bidder that might be involved in a cartel after identifying the same abnormal behavior in a series of tenders through simple calculations and a new type of graph.}

abstract = {Empirical work on auctions has found that bidders deviate from standard behavior in important ways. We investigate a range of these behaviors, including nonrational herding, auction fever, quasi-endowment effect, and escalation of commitment. Our innovations are to more completely control for unobservables by using new data from a field experiment on eBay, and by accounting for censoring of bids below the starting price. Consistent with standard auction theory and in contrast to the predictions of the nonstandard behaviors, we find that auction starting price has no effect on bidder willingness to pay in a private-values setting. We conclude that there is little evidence that these nonstandard behaviors are important in the field.}

The present paper proposed a new dressing method—biological in-process dressing (BID)—for metal-bonded abrasive tools. The cell-free culture supernatant filtered from cultured microorganisms was continuously sprayed on the surface of a Cu–Co bonded diamond tool to conduct the dressing process. BID experiments were conducted on a series of fixed diamond pads for the lapping of silica glass and sapphire. The material removal rate (MRR), machined surface roughness (Sa), tool surface topography, and thickness loss of the diamond tool were measured during lapping experiments. It was found that BID effectively exposed all diamond grains and improved the machining quality and efficiency. The dressing mechanism of BID was schematically illustrated.}
