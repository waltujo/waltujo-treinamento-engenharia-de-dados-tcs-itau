abstract = {Shareholder value creation from hedge fund activism occurs primarily by influencing takeover outcomes for targeted firms. Controlling for selection decisions, activist interventions substantially increase the probability of a takeover offer. Third-party bids for targets have higher returns, premia, and completion rates, but these patterns reverse when the activist is the bidder. Failed bids for activism targets lead to improvements in operating performance, financial policy, and positive long-term abnormal returns, suggesting that activism enhances value. The positive long-term performance from hedge fund activism arises from monitoring target management during merger and acquisition contests and not from target undervaluation or bidder overpayment.}

Atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic, highly pruritic skin disorder, impairs quality of life (QoL). Janus kinase inhibitors suppress inflammatory and pruritus-associated cytokine signaling in AD.
Objective
To report the effects of ruxolitinib (RUX) cream on itch and QoL in AD.
Methods
A total of 307 adult patients with an Investigator's Global Assessment (score of 2 or 3) and 3% to 20% affected body surface area were randomly assigned for 8 weeks to receive double-blind treatment with RUX (1.5% twice daily, 1.5% once daily, 0.5% once daily, or 0.15% once daily), vehicle twice daily, or triamcinolone cream (0.1% twice daily for 4 weeks then vehicle for 4 weeks). Itch was measured by using the numerical rating scale, and patient QoL was assessed with Skindex-16.
Results
Improvements in itch numerical rating scale and Skindex-16 were observed with RUX cream. Overall, 42.5% of patients who applied 1.5% RUX twice daily experienced minimal clinically important difference in itch within 36 hours of treatment (vehicle, 13.6%; P < .01); near-maximal improvement was observed by week 4. Itch reduction was associated with improved QoL burden (Pearson correlation, 0.67; P < .001). Significant improvements in Skindex-16 overall scores were noted at week 2.
Limitations
Facial AD lesions were not treated.
Conclusion
RUX cream provides a clinically meaningful reduction in itch and QoL burden.}

abstract = {Introduction
Comprehensive medication management (CMM) is a patient care process provided by clinical pharmacists in primary care settings that ensures optimal use of medications with timely follow-up. Despite widespread evidence that shows CMM improves clinical and medication-related outcomes, pharmacist-delivered CMM services often fail to be adopted into U.S. primary care settings.
Objective
This study presents a conceptual framework linking outcomes of pharmacist-delivered CMM services in primary care settings to financial benefits for health plans providing coverage of CMM services and primary care practices investing and implementing CMM.
Methods
A critical review of the literature was performed in PubMed and the gray literature to identify financing opportunities that justify the coverage of CMM by third-party health plan administrators or the implementation of CMM by primary care practices. Financing elements that could be impacted by pharmacist-led CMM outcomes, namely higher achievement of medication-related quality measures and reduction of total costs of care, were recorded and utilized to develop the conceptual framework.
Results
The framework suggests that CMM provides economic benefits to both health plans and primary care practices by increasing market competitiveness, direct revenue, and quality bonuses. Health plans may benefit from higher plan quality ratings, lower premiums and plan bids, increased shared savings, and quality bonus payments. Primary care practices may achieve increased negotiating power through accreditation recognition and patient satisfaction, increased revenue through shared savings and fee-for-service reimbursement, and achievement of quality bonus payments.
Conclusions
The alignment of economic benefits from CMM advances a strong value proposition for greater adoption of CMM coverage by health plans and implementation in the U.S. primary care system. Through broader CMM implementation, pharmacists can work alongside physicians in advanced care models and play a vital role in shaping the primary care practice transition to value-based care.}

A toehold provides an opportunity to interact with the target and its management and in the process get a better sense of the possible synergies from a merger or takeover. A bidder considering taking over a target will take a toehold beforehand if the informational benefits are large. Our model makes the following predictions: (i) a toehold is more beneficial if a target is opaque, i.e., if it is generally harder to value potential synergies with the target; (ii) a toehold is incrementally more beneficial if a bidder initially finds it harder than others to assess the value of potential synergies; (iii) that incremental benefit is less important, however, if the target is opaque; and (iv) the benefits from having a toehold are smaller if the number of potential rival bidders is higher. We test these predictions using a large sample of majority acquisitions of private and public companies for which we have information regarding whether the acquirer had a toehold in the target company prior to the majority acquisition. We find evidence consistent with our hypotheses, and thus with the idea that potential acquirers of a target use toeholds to improve their information about possible synergies with the target.}

We study herding behavior, defined as a greater likelihood of bidding in auctions with more existing bids, in P2P loan auctions on Prosper.com. The results of an empirical study provide evidence of strategic herding behavior by lenders such that they have a greater likelihood of bidding on an auction with more bids (a 1% increase in the number of bids increases the likelihood of an additional bid by 15%), but only to the point at which it has received full funding. After this point, herding diminishes (a 1% increase in bids increases the likelihood of an additional bid by only 5%). We also find a positive association between herding in the loan auction and its subsequent performance, that is, whether borrowers pay the money back on time. Unlike eBay auctions where herding impacts bidders adversely, our findings reveal that strategic herding behavior in P2P loan auctions benefits bidders, individually and collectively.}

Through its various extensions, the model is able to predict the effect of different ranking and payment policies on auction performance in terms of consumer surplus as well as advertisers’ and search engine profits. The theoretical model demonstrates that 1) payment policies should not have an effect on auction performance, 2) ranking policies that do not include the advertiser’s bid as a ranking criterion should not have an effect on auction performance 3) policies that use advertisers’ bids as the single ranking criterion should be just as good as using advertisers’ bids combined with other criteria over which advertisers have no short-term influence (e.g., relevance and click-through rate), 4) some sort of a coordination mechanism is necessary in order for buyers and sellers to achieve a fully efficient outcome, however, coordination should prove much more difficult when the bid is not used as at least one of the ranking criteria, 5) decreasing the number of sponsored links shown to consumers and displaying product prices should improve coordination and increase the likelihood of a fully efficient outcome. We use economically-motivated human subjects and the methods of experimental economics to test the first two of the model’s predictions. We investigate six different sponsored search auction formats: two different pricing policies (pay-per-transaction and pay-per-click) and three different ranking policies (rank by relevance, rank by click-through rate, & rank by both relevance and click-through rate). As predicted by the model we find no significant effect due to difference in ranking policies. However, contrary to the model’s predictions, we find significant differences in total surplus due to payment policies. We discuss two behavioral effects that could be the reason for these differences.}

Ultralow-dose opioid antagonists have been demonstrated to enhance and prolong opiate analgesia and alleviate opioid tolerance and withdrawal in rodents. This 3-week, Phase II clinical trial assessed safety and analgesic efficacy of Oxytrex in patients with moderate to severe pain from osteoarthritis. Patients with a pain score ≥5 received placebo, oxycodone 4 times a day (qid), Oxytrex qid, or Oxytrex twice a day (bid). All active treatment groups received the same total daily dose and dose escalation of oxycodone starting at 10 and ending at 40 mg/day. Importantly, the Oxytrex bid group received a lower daily dose of naltrexone than Oxytrex qid (0.002 vs 0.004 mg/day). Oxytrex bid produced a 39% reduction in pain intensity, which was significantly greater than that of placebo (P < .001), oxycodone qid (P = .006), and Oxytrex qid (P = .003). Oxytrex bid was also superior to placebo in quality of analgesia (P = .002), duration of pain control each day (P = .05), patients’ global assessments (P = .04), and the Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score (P = .03). The incidence of side effects was comparable between active treatments. In this Phase II dose-ranging study, Oxytrex bid demonstrated greater pain relief with a more convenient dosing schedule compared to oxycodone qid.
Perspective
Preclinical data have shown ultralow-dose opioid antagonists to enhance and prolong opioid analgesia while reducing analgesic tolerance and physical dependence. Recent molecular pharmacology data show a mechanism of action to be the prevention of aberrant G protein coupling by opioid receptors that underlies opioid tolerance and dependence.}

Further, no detailed empirical examination of both liquidity and risk premia in the New Zealand electricity futures market are discernible. Using data from October 2009 to December 2015, we address these gaps in the literature. We find that liquidity has been gradually increasing and that a policy intervention to impose a maximum bid-offer spread was associated with liquidity-enhancing structural breaks, but this was evident only in the nearest-to-maturity futures contracts. Further, we develop models to explain risk premia that include a range of risk factors, which we categorise as either statistical, physical market, production cost or liquidity variables. From this analysis, we document significant time-varying premia that are driven by potentially inefficient behaviour. Finally, we find that liquidity risk does affect risk premia, but generally only in the case of longer-dated futures.}

Although contracts won under competitive tendering or by negotiation are assessed on a number of evaluation criteria, cost efficiency still remains the main basis for selecting a preferred operator. There has been a limited effort to identify the service quality influences that really matter to users of public transport. Ways of incorporating the packaging of service quality offer an improved and behaviourally richer way of representing the role of underlying dimensions of quality in establishing how well a contracted service is delivering services to satisfy customers. In this chapter we present a way of doing this using a construct called a Customer Service Quality Index (CSQI), in which a stated preference survey together with actual experience in using public transport is used to obtain preference weights for each significant attribute defining service quality, and which is used then to establish a CSQI for each sampled user, and by aggregation, the performance on service quality of each operator. Such a measure should be considered by regulators when both assessing the merits of each operator's bid in order to avoid the real risk that cost efficiency dominates at the expense of gains in service performance and in ongoing monitoring of performance.}

In this paper, I investigate the link between information asymmetry, measured by bid-ask spread, and increased accounting disclosures following the adoption of new auditing standards in China—an environment in which disclosure hitherto was relatively low. I report the following primary results of the statistical analyses. First, information asymmetry cost is substantial in the Chinese order-driven emerging markets. Second, the firms in the sample experienced significant reductions in their bid-ask spreads subsequent to the adoption of the new auditing standards. Third, the reductions in the bid-ask spreads were abrupt and permanent. However, no significant result is found for firms in the control group with foreign ownership, whose financial statements were prepared in accordance with international accounting standards and were audited with international auditing standards. The results have implications for policy makers and regulators in general, and those in emerging markets in particular.}

We estimate the distributions of bids and bidders' private valuations using a nonparametric structural model and assuming independence and asymmetry between participants. Petrobras, the Brazilian state-owned petroleum giant and former oil sector monopolist, was considered a competitor that was distinct from other competitors. Thus, we investigate a database based on information from all auctions held between 1999 and 2008. The results suggest that Petrobras earned significantly higher information rents than other competitors. Such rents ranged from 15% to 63%, depending on the number and type of competitors.}

abstract = {Around the world, government policies to support new renewable energy technologies rely on accurate estimates of Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE). This paper reveals that such estimates are based on “public domain” data which may be unreliable. A new approach and methodology has been developed which uses United Kingdom (UK) “audited” data, published in company accounts, that has been obtained from Companies House, to determine more accurate LCOE estimates. The methodology is applicable to projects configured within Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) companies. The methodology is then applied to a number of UK offshore wind farms and one Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) project to develop new cost data which is then compared to that presently in the public domain. The analysis reveals that recent offshore wind projects show a slightly declining LCOE and that public domain cost estimates are unreliable. But of most concern is that offshore wind farm costs are still much higher than those implied by recent bids for UK government financial support via Contracts for Difference (CfDs). The paper concludes by addressing further the question of how offshore wind projects can achieve the degree of LCOE reductions required by recent CfD bids.}

abstract = {In most metropolises, commuters spend a considerable amount of time on public transport, and many of them entertain themselves with the content (like music or videos) on their mobile devices to alleviate boredom. Currently, the content, usually shared in co-located wireless networks to avoid huge monetary cost of using cellular data, is delivered from single host (resource owner) to single request user, which brings low transmission quality, due to the uncertainty of mobile edge networks in public transport environments. In this paper, we present an intelligent incentive framework called GoSharing which encourages multiple hosts to share content collaboratively to improve delivery quality, by taking advantage of users’ association and consideration of network Quality of Service(QoS) requirements. The highlight of GoSharing is the novel Association-based Intelligent incentive mechanism that consists of three key components. First, a Fast Candidate Generation algorithm discovers users’ association according to their stored content and QoS requirements and filters the candidate groups from large host groups. Second, a Host Selection algorithm finds a near-optimal solution among candidate groups within an approximate factor of F(d), where d denotes the maximum size of completed tasks when any candidate group is selected. Last but not least, a Payment Determination algorithm determines the payment of resource contributors while guaranteeing the truthfulness of their bids based on the procurement auction. Both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that GoSharing not only effectively motivates hosts’ collaborative sharing, but also achieves the properties of truthfulness, individual rationality, high computational efficiency, low overpayment ratio, and high download ratio.}

Comparison of naproxcinod (375 and 750 mg), placebo (up to 13 weeks), and naproxen 500 mg (all bid) for treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) signs and symptoms.
Methods
A 53-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. One thousand twenty patients with primary knee OA were randomized to naproxcinod 750 mg, naproxcinod 375 mg, naproxen 500 mg, or placebo (all bid). Coprimary efficacy endpoints were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC™) pain and function subscales and patient overall rating of disease status. An analysis of covariance model tested superiority for both naproxcinod doses over placebo at week 13, and noninferiority of naproxcinod 750 mg bid versus naproxen at weeks 13 and 26.
Results
Least-square mean changes from baseline were greater for both naproxcinod doses compared with placebo at week 13 for WOMAC pain (−31.3 [standard error 1.67], −28.1 [1.64], and −20.4 [1.62] mm with naproxcinod 750 mg bid [P < 0.0001], 375 mg bid [P = 0.0008], and placebo, respectively), WOMAC function (−27.8 [1.60], −23.8 [1.58], and −14.9 [1.56] mm, respectively, P < 0.0001), and patient overall rating of disease status (1.00 [0.061], 0.81 [0.060], and 0.49 [0.059], respectively, P < 0.0001). Naproxcinod 750 mg bid was noninferior to naproxen at weeks 13 and 26. Naproxcinod was well tolerated, with no notable differences in orthostatic blood pressure response between treatments.
Conclusion
Naproxcinod 750 mg bid and 375 mg bid demonstrated superior efficacy over placebo for treatment of OA and were well tolerated over 1 year. Naproxcinod 750 mg bid was noninferior to naproxen 500 mg bid.}

This could raise the equilibrium bid implying that the subsidy reduction rationale for introducing competitive tendering is partly invalidated.

Current guidelines recommend acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) treatment after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to reduce thrombotic vein graft occlusion. The optimal dosage of ASA is not known.
Materials and methods
Forty-two patients undergoing elective CABG were randomized to receive either ASA 75mg or 160mg once daily (OD) or 75mg twice daily (BID) after the operation. Platelet function testing was performed before, and one and three months after the operation.
Results
White blood cell counts increased during the initial postoperative days whereas platelet counts were initially slightly reduced after the operation but increased after one month without any major changes of mean platelet volumes. Serum thromboxane B2 was more effectively suppressed at one and three months after the operation with ASA 75mg BID or 160mg OD than with 75mg OD (p<0.001). ASA 75mg BID and 160mg OD were equally effective. Adenosine diphosphate stimulated platelet aggregation in whole blood (Multiplate®) was increased one and three months after the operation, and this was counteracted by ASA 75mg BID but not by 75 or 160mg OD. Arachidonic acid-induced aggregation was more effectively inhibited by 75mg BID or 160mg OD compared to 75mg OD at three months.
Conclusions
Less effective inhibition of platelet activation was obtained with ASA 75mg OD than with ASA 160mg OD or 75mg BID up to three months after CABG. Especially the latter dose is of interest for further studies of efficacy and clinical outcomes after CABG.}

abstract = {A large number of papers have introduced novel machine learning and feature extraction methods for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, while the vast majority of these works use the public dataset ADNI for evaluation, they are difficult to reproduce because different key components of the validation are often not readily available. These components include selected participants and input data, image preprocessing and cross-validation procedures. The performance of the different approaches is also difficult to compare objectively. In particular, it is often difficult to assess which part of the method (e.g. preprocessing, feature extraction or classification algorithms) provides a real improvement, if any. In the present paper, we propose a framework for reproducible and objective classification experiments in AD using three publicly available datasets (ADNI, AIBL and OASIS). The framework comprises: i) automatic conversion of the three datasets into a standard format (BIDS); ii) a modular set of preprocessing pipelines, feature extraction and classification methods, together with an evaluation framework, that provide a baseline for benchmarking the different components. We demonstrate the use of the framework for a large-scale evaluation on 1960 participants using T1 MRI and FDG PET data. In this evaluation, we assess the influence of different modalities, preprocessing, feature types (regional or voxel-based features), classifiers, training set sizes and datasets. Performances were in line with the state-of-the-art. FDG PET outperformed T1 MRI for all classification tasks. No difference in performance was found for the use of different atlases, image smoothing, partial volume correction of FDG PET images, or feature type. Linear SVM and L2-logistic regression resulted in similar performance and both outperformed random forests. The classification performance increased along with the number of subjects used for training. Classifiers trained on ADNI generalized well to AIBL and OASIS. All the code of the framework and the experiments is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at: https://gitlab.icm-institute.org/aramislab/AD-ML.}

Based on the systemic thinking and stakeholder theory, this paper sets up the criteria system for “bid/no-bid decision” and the index system for “which project to bid”, and then constructs respectively the evaluation models with the logical valuation method and Grey Target method. Conclusion: the establishment of design projects’ bidding selection systems should manage to realize the benefits equilibrium between stakeholders, considering the different interests requirement from different interests groups.

The methodology is not restricted to the two-stage markets often reported in the literature—a day-ahead bid submission followed by an adjustment in the imbalance market. Instead, it allows studying any number of markets operating on the same dispatch hour. Particularly, this paper analyzes part of the Spanish market, covering the day-ahead, the six intraday, and the imbalance market. They are markets with different schedules, but this paper shows that by simply rearranging the market prices into a single equivalent market and employing the increments of power as bids, the calculations are visibly simplified; despite the different scope and gate closures. The methodology also includes a dynamic programming approach that relies on the equivalent market data to provide an optimal bidding sequence and its economic value when (i) uncertain prices and wind power production are considered, and (ii) energy storage is employed. As an application, the proposed methodology is employed to analyze the revenues derived by a wind power producer using ESS in the Spanish market.}

Currently, some online auctions, such as eBay, introduce a proxy bidding policy, under which bidders submit their maximum bids and delegate to a proxy agent to automatically outbid other competitors for the top bidder, whereas other online auctions do not. This paper compares these two widely used auction mechanisms (proxy setting and non-proxy setting) and characterizes the equilibrium bidding behavior and the seller's expected revenue. We find the proxy auction outperforms the non-proxy auction in terms of the seller's expected revenue. This dominance result is not prone to the specific bid announcement policy, the bidder's knowledge regarding the number of bidders, the impact of traffic congestion along the bidding process, the number of items sold through the auction, and the existence of a reserve price. We further find that the proxy setting usually fails to sustain the truthful bidding as a dominant strategy equilibrium even if no minimum bid increments are adopted, and the possibility of a low-valuation-bidder dilemma where the low-valuation bidders could be better off if all bidders collude to bid at the last minute. We also discuss the dramatically different equilibrium bidding behaviors under the two auction mechanisms.}

Fifty-two 10-month-olds and their mothers were assessed in order to investigate concurrent predictors of infant parallel attention, responding to joint attention, and initiating joint attention.
Results
Parallel attention was predicted by infants’ higher mental development, low expression of negative emotionality, and maternal entertaining behaviors. Responding to joint attention was marginally predicted by total maternal bids for joint attention. Initiating joint attention was predicted by the infants’ low expression of negative emotionality, as well as marginally predicted by fewer maternal teaching behaviors.

To develop and validate a concise, parent-completed Brief Intellectual Disability Scale (BIDS) for children in low–disability resource and high–disability care burden countries.
Study Design and Setting
In this prospective cross-sectional study of 124 children recruited from a facility for intellectual disability (ID), the newly developed BIDS as the measure for validation as well as for the gold standard and convergent and divergent validities was administered by independent raters. Tests for diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and validity were conducted at the item and scale levels.
Results
The BIDS scores of ≥5 (sensitivity [Sn]=71.43%, specificity [Sp]=80.95%) and ≥11 (Sn=4.29%, Sp=100%), with area under the curve of 0.79, are suggested, respectively, for screening and diagnostic use in Indian populations. The inter-rater reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.96) and test–retest reliability at 4 weeks (ICC=0.95) for BIDS are strong. Besides the adequate face and content validities, BIDS demonstrates good internal consistency (Cronbach α=0.80) and item-total correlation. There is moderate convergent validity with Binet–Kamat Test of Intelligence or Gesell's Developmental Schedule (r=−0.66, P=0.001) as well as with adaptive behavior measure of Vineland Social Maturity Scale (r=−0.52, P=0.001) and low divergent validity with the subscales of Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity: Comprehensive Teacher Rating Scale (r=−0.11, P=0.7; r=0.18, P=0.5; r=0.13, P=0.6; r=0.08, P=0.7). An exploratory factor analysis demonstrated a three-factor structure, explaining 60% of variance.
Conclusion
The BIDS shows promise as a psychometrically adequate, yet brief measure for identifying ID in countries with low disability care resources and high disability-related burden.}

This dataset was generated as part of the following article: Multivariate consistency of resting-state fMRI connectivity maps acquired on a single individual over 2.5 years, 13 sites and 3 vendors [1]. Acquired on three 3T scanner vendors (GE, Siemens and Philips), the Csub dataset is part of an ongoing effort to monitor the quality and comparability of MRI data collected across the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) imaging network. The participant was scanned 25 times in the above-mentioned article: multiple times at six sites over a period of 2.5 years, and once at the remaining seven sites. Since then the participant was scanned an additional 45 times, allowing us to extend the dataset to 70 rsfMRI scans over a period of >4 years. In addition, we provide intra- and inter-subject consistency values of rsfMRI connectivity maps derived from 26 adult participants belonging to the publicly released Hangzhou Normal University dataset (HNU1). All HNU1 participants underwent 10 rsfMRI scans over one month on a single 3T scanner (GE). Connectivity maps of seven canonical networks were generated for each scan in the two datasets (Csub and HNU1). All consistency values, along with the scripts used to preprocess the rsfMRI data and generate connectivity maps and pairwise consistency values, have been made available on two public repositories, Github and Zenodo. We have also made available four Jupyter notebooks that use the provided consistency values to (a) generate interactive graphical summaries – 1 notebook, (b) perform statistical analyses - 2 notebooks, and (c) perform data-driven cluster analysis for the recovery of subject identity (i.e. rsfMRI fingerprinting) – 1 notebook. In addition, we provide two interactive dashboards that allow visualization of individual connectivity maps from the two datasets. Finally, we also provide minimally preprocessed rsfMRI data in Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS) format on all 70 scans in the extended dataset.}

abstract = {The rapid growth in information technology and related talent has let to a competition among the investors to look for the best available talent. Additionally, the diverse range of directions in technology, gives a lot of options to the applicants to choose from. In such a scenario, it is imperative to link the most appropriate investors and developers in a secure and cost optimal way. Blockchain technology helps in creating a decentralized network of users where the transactions are recorded in an open distributed ledger. These features of blockchain enable a transparent and cost-effective platform for different applications. Based on the need to an effective crowdfunding platform for developing smart nation and the inherent features of blockchain technology, we propose a global crowdfunding platform called BitFund. Investors and developers can act as different nodes of the network. The investors can request a specific project and they can give their initial bid value in terms of time, cost and maintenance required. Different developers can bid with different values of the same parameters to get the project ownership. A smart contract is deployed between the investors and the developers to reach an optimal solution for the investors. Multiple iterations of bidding are carried out between the developers until the optimal solution or equilibrium is reached. The experimental results show that the proposed model yields better results as compared to other generic algorithms for crowdfunding.}

This study investigated the effect of supplementation of IVC medium with an ER stress inducer, tunicamycin (TM), and an inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), on the developmental competence, apoptosis, and gene expression in buffalo embryos produced by IVF. Treatment of presumed zygotes with TM resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in the blastocyst rate, whereas TUDCA supplementation did not improve the blastocyst development rate. Further, presence of TUDCA could not ameliorate the adverse effects of TM in terms of the blastocyst rate in combined (TM + TUDCA) treatment. Tunicamycin treatment increased (P < 0.01) the apoptotic index and reduced the total cell number, whereas TUDCA did not affect them significantly. However, TUDCA reduced the extent of TM-mediated apoptosis during combined (TM + TUDCA) treatment. Tunicamycin treatment increased (P < 0.01) and TUDCA treatment decreased (P < 0.01) the expression level of ER chaperones, GRP78 and GRP94. In the combined TM + TUDCA treatment, TUDCA decreased their expression level compared to that in the controls. A similar pattern was observed in the case of proapoptotic gene BAX. We did not find any significant difference in the expression level of BCl-XL, BID, P53, and CASPASE 3 after TM and TUDCA supplementation. In conclusion, our study reported that TM induces ER stress in buffalo embryos produced in vitro resulting in a decrease in the blastocyst rate and an increase in the level of apoptosis and that these actions are mediated by modulating the expression of apoptosis-related genes and ER chaperones. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid did not improve the developmental potential of buffalo embryos; however, it attenuated the TM-induced apoptosis by downregulating BAX and ER chaperones.}

To assess the relative efficacy and safety of basal insulin regimens in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
Methods
A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials comparing two or more basal insulin regimens were conducted. The following basal insulin regimens were included: Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (iNPH) (once [od], twice [bid], and four times daily [qid]), insulin detemir (iDet) (od and bid), insulin glargine 100 IU (iGlarg) (od), and insulin degludec (iDegl) (od). We searched the following databases: MEDLINE via OVID, Embase via OVID, and the Cochrane Library (Wiley). Study quality was appraised using Cochrane risk-of-bias checklist for randomized controlled trials. Two outcomes (change in hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] and rate of severe/major hypoglycemia [SH]) were analyzed. Network inconsistency was assessed using Bucher and chi-square tests.
Results
Thirty studies met the eligibility criteria. Twenty-five were included in the HbA1c network and 16 in the SH network. All studies were of moderate quality. No network inconsistency was evident in the HbA1c network. Of the seven regimens of interest, iDet (bid) had the highest probability of being best (mean change in HbA1c −0.48; 95% credible interval −0.69 to −0.29). In contrast, the SH network demonstrated both considerable uncertainty and significant network inconsistency (χ2 test, P = 0.003).
Conclusions
Of the specified frequency regimens, iDet (bid) had the highest probability of being the best basal insulin regimen in terms of reduction in HbA1c. Ranking of the regimens in terms of the SH rate was highly uncertain and no clear conclusion could be made.}

In this study, simultaneous sequential timber auctions are modelled and analysed using agent-based simulation technology. As there are many individual items in the auction to be sold, the auction designer defines several rounds that are sequential at pre-defined intervals. At each round, the auction designer announces several simultaneous auctions. Since bidders are offered different items at each round, a mathematical linear programing model for selecting the best set of items to bid for is presented. Different bidding patterns are simulated and compared in various setup configurations. The most advanced of these strategies are adaptive and use agent-learning capability. The comparisons include the success rate of winning the auction and the winning price per m3. This study suggests an efficient bidding pattern for bidders to bid in order to achieve to their goal and increase their profit. Similarly, in order to increase profit, the auctioneer (i.e. the government) needs to control several auction parameters including the number of auctions per year, the lot size, the auction periodicity, and the number of bidders. This study also suggests parameters configurations that to maximise revenue for the auctioneer.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study sought to compare the net clinical benefit of dabigatran 110 mg bid and 150 mg bid with that of warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
Background
In patients with AF, dabigatran 110 mg bid and 150 mg bid are associated with similar rates of death. However, the higher dose reduces ischemic stroke and increases bleeding compared with the lower dose. Therefore, there is uncertainty about how to evaluate the overall benefit of the 2 doses.
Methods
In 18,113 AF patients in the RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long Term Anticoagulant Therapy) trial, we used a previously developed method for integrating ischemic and bleeding events as “ischemic stroke equivalents” in order to compare a weighted benefit of 2 doses of dabigatran with each other, and with that of warfarin.
Results
Compared with warfarin, there was a significant decrease in ischemic stroke equivalents with both dabigatran doses: –0.92 per 100 patient years (95% confidence interval [CI]: –1.74 to −0.21, p = 0.02) with dabigatran 110 mg bid and –1.08 (95% CI: –1.86 to −0.34, p = 0.01) with dabigatran 150 mg bid. There was no significant difference in ischemic stroke equivalents between the 2 doses: –0.16 (95% CI: –0.80 to 0.43) comparing dabigatran 150 mg bid with 110 bid. When including death in the weighted benefit calculations, the results were similar.
Conclusions
On a group level both doses of dabigatran as compared with warfarin have similar benefits when considering a weighted estimate including both efficacy and safety. The similar overall benefits of the 2 doses of dabigatran versus warfarin support individualizing the dose based on patient characteristics and physician and patient preferences.

Unlike most current one-size-fits-all health plan designs, value-based insurance design (V-BID) explicitly acknowledges clinical heterogeneity across the continuum of care. By adding clinical nuance to benefit design, V-BID seeks to align consumer and provider incentives with value, encouraging the use of high-value services and discouraging the use of low-value interventions. This article describes the concept of V-BID; creates a framework for its development in pulmonary medicine; and outlines how this concept aligns with research, care delivery, and payment reform initiatives.}

However, if the absolute CD is perceived differently depending on the acquirer's home base, it may yield disparate effects in cross-border M&A (CB M&A) transactions. Consistently, we find that the relationship between CD and CB M&A premiums is not uniform, but varies by acquirer origin. While we find a strong negative association between CD and premiums when U.S. firms bid for foreign targets, no such negative association is observed when foreign bidders evaluate U.S. targets. Using traveler flows, student exchanges, and previous acquisitions as proxies for directional cross-cultural familiarity, we provide evidence that familiarity with the target's national culture is related to the magnitude of CD discount in a systematic way and thus explains the observed asymmetry. Our findings highlight the existence, as well as the source, of the asymmetric property in the relationship between CD and target premiums in CB M&A.}

We argue that auctions are not only affected by their information cues but also by contrasting, peripheral information cues from adjacent auction listings. Applying contrast effects theory, we examined the moderating effects of time urgency and persuasion intent on the processing of contrasting peripheral information from adjacent auctions. Using two controlled experiments and an empirical field study, we showed that time urgency experienced by bidders in online auctions resulted in increased heuristic processing of contrasting information from adjacent auction listings. Under time pressure, bidders were more likely to be affected by this contrasting peripheral information. We also found that bidders will discount contrasting peripheral information if they perceive salient persuasion intents in advertising presented by the auctioneers. The resulting contrast effects ultimately lead to changes in willingness-to-pay and underscore the importance of peripheral information from adjacent auctions in impacting auction outcomes.}

WBR is the ratio of the winning bid of an auction to the buy price offered by the seller. We find that choosing a high bid increment and including a shipping price decreases the WBR. Alternatively, lower number of bids and choosing a shorter auction length have a positive effect on the WBR. On the whole, the ending rule has a negative effect on the WBR, which is in accord with the theoretical predictions in the literature. However, we also find variations in the results for the effect of ending rule when we divide the data into two groups consisting of high and low-value auctions.}

We provide an explanation for this puzzle: Bidding in sealed bid auctions for new issues is complex, particularly when the underlying shares are difficult to value and the auction is open to large numbers of potential bidders, some of whom might be naïve. Participation fluctuations make it difficult for even sophisticated bidders to shave accurately for the winner’s curse, and mistakes by some bidders impose costs on all. Our findings suggest that a hybrid auction mechanism that limits participation in the auction tranche to sophisticated investors, along with a non-competitive tranche that is open to all investors, can reduce such mistakes while at the same time providing the necessary incentives for information gathering.}

To determine the benefits of alvimopan and multimodal pain management strategies in men undergoing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testicular cancer.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was completed in men undergoing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection from January 2017 to May 2018. Patients were placed into the 3-drug, 2-drug, and control cohorts as a result of a prospectively determined protocol during the study period. Men in the 3-drug group were managed using alvimopan 12 mg PO the morning of surgery then BID until bowel movement, gabapentin 300 mg daily, and acetaminophen 1,000 mg q6H. The 2-drug group was managed with the above regimen excluding alvimopan. Controls were treated per our standard perioperative pathway. Primary outcomes were length of stay, IV narcotic consumption, bowel movement during hospitalization, and time to bowel movement and assessed in multivariate models controlling for operative time, concomitant surgery, chemotherapy receipt, and residual mass size.
Results
One-hundred and fifty-two consecutive patients underwent RPLND (42 3-drug, 38 2-drug, and 72 controls). Multivariable models indicated that the 3-drug (IRR 0.89, P < 0.0001) and 2-drug group (IRR 0.87, P = 0.0209) had shorter hospital stays than controls. Men in the 3-drug group required less narcotic pain medication than the 2-drug (β −8.16, P = 0.0405) and the control (β −8.16, P = 0.0302) group. Men receiving alvimopan (3-drug) were almost 6 times more likely than the 2-drug group (odds ratio 5.94, P < 0.0001) and 4 times more likely than the control group (odds ratio 3.86, P = 0.0017) to have a bowel movement during hospitalization. Men in the 3-drug group had the quickest return of bowel movements.
Conclusions
Multimodal pain management improves length of stay in men undergoing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testis cancer. The addition of alvimopan allows for quicker return of bowel movements and reduces overall narcotic requirements.}

However, only a limited number of studies have quantitatively estimated the potential impact of bid preference on the emission reduction from building construction. The aim of this paper is to improve our understanding of how bid discounts change owners' procurement costs and the magnitudes of emission mitigation. A two-stage optimization model is designed to help the owner determine the discount rate that would automatically control the emission of the awarded contract within a desired level. The goal is for bidders to regard emission reduction efforts as an investment, with returns coming in the form of an increased chance of winning the bid. Our results imply that for the building retrofit project studied herein, a discount rate of 0.6 is suggested for every percentage of emission reduction. This discount level reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 28.2% while raising procurement costs by 3.7% relative to a non-preference mechanism. The increased procurement costs can be partially compensated under existing cap-and-trade scheme. The results show that the choice of discount significantly alters bidders' efforts on emission mitigation, and emission control cost can be minimized with the proposed optimization algorithm.}

abstract = {Online auctions use a variety of unique tools to provide quality signals for products and sellers in an attempt to overcome the online marketplace's limitations. These tools include feedback ratings and symbols that indicate reputation. However, surprisingly few studies have investigated the effects of reputation indicators in the decision-making process in online marketplaces. No prior study in our knowledge has examined the role of graphics indicators in online decision-making. We investigated the decision process and the price premium an individual was willing to pay for a product using an experiment with the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak procedure and event-related measures of brain activity. As signaling theory expects, results showed that the price premium paid for a product was higher when the product sold by a seller appeared with a high-reputation symbol. High-reputation seller indicators triggered significantly higher neural activity compared with low-reputation seller indicators in brain regions associated with emotions in the prefrontal cortex (the ventromedial prefrontal cortex). The degree of integrated cognitive value and cognitive and emotional value as represented by neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and VMPFC respectively was correlated with the price premium individuals bid for products. The results indicate the applicability of semeiotic theory along with signaling theory in the e-marketplace context and suggest fruitful avenues for further research.}

We find that although the bid-ask spreads decrease, this is not due to a fall in information asymmetries and a fall in the adverse selection costs. We find supporting evidence that the fall in the spread could be due to lower inventory holding costs as a result of lower depth when futures trade. We also find volatility to increase when futures trade accompanied by increases in trading volume supporting the scenario that institutional investors take large positions in both derivative and the underlying markets creating price pressures. This paper has indicated that market quality might not necessarily improve with futures trading, in contrast to the results of previous studies, which applied a pre-post futures listing analysis and used lower frequency data.}

Frooman's (1999) typology of stakeholder influence strategies is used to analyse the negotiation of resource relationships between a Gold Coast franchise bid team and its key stakeholders. Primary data came from 12 interviews with nine key actors in the bid process; these were buttressed by secondary data. Frooman's typology provided a useful heuristic, but did not fully account for the critical role of firm legitimacy in stakeholders’ choice of influence strategies. The bid team negotiated stakeholders’ initial direct withholding strategies by creating access to the intangible resource of legitimacy. This subsequently provided access to material resources such as finance, a new stadium, and, ultimately, a franchise license. The findings are of note to practitioners and scholars interested professional sport and stakeholder theory.}

abstract = {This paper presents a two-level optimization problem for optimal day-ahead scheduling of an active distribution system that utilizes renewable energy sources, distributed generation units, electric vehicles, and energy storage units and sells its surplus electricity to the upward electricity market. The active distribution system transacts electricity with multiple downward energy hubs that are equipped with combined cooling, heating, and power facilities. Each energy hub operator optimizes its day-ahead scheduling problem and submits its bid/offer to the upward distribution system operator. Afterwards, the distribution system operator explores the energy hub’s bids/offers and optimizes the scheduling of its system energy resources for the day-ahead market. Further, he/she utilizes a demand response program alternative such as time-of-use and direct load control programs for downward energy hubs. In order to demonstrate the preference of the proposed method, the standard IEEE 33-bus test system is used to model the distribution system, and multiple energy hubs are used to model the energy hubs system. The proposed method increases the energy hubs electricity selling benefit about 185% with respect to the base case value; meanwhile, it reduces the distribution system operational costs about 82.2% with respect to the corresponding base case value.}

abstract = {The prevalent term “auction fever” visualizes that ascending auctions – inconsistent with theory – are likely to provoke higher bids than one-shot auctions. To explore and isolate causes of auction fever experimentally, we design four different strategy-proof auction formats and order these according to expected rising bids based on pseudo-endowment effect arguments (psychological ownership and disparity between willingness to pay and willingness to accept). Observed revenues in the experiment in the four formats rank as expected if bidders have private uncertain values (the private information of a bidder is the distribution of her value). A control treatment supports our view that the traditional private certain values approach prevents auction fever in the laboratory. Another control treatment with a procurement auction relates the auction fever bids to bids in a one-shot auction with real endowments. We conclude that, when bidders are uncertain about their valuations, auctions that foster pseudo-endowment may raise bids and revenues.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose was to report the effects of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF; also known as gastro-resistant DMF) on the number of relapses requiring intravenous (IV) steroids and multiple sclerosis (MS)-related hospitalizations using integrated data from the Phase III DEFINE and CONFIRM studies.
Methods
DEFINE and CONFIRM were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of DMF over a 2-year period in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive oral DMF 240 mg BID or TID, placebo, or glatiramer acetate (CONFIRM only). Eligible subjects (aged 18–55 years) had an EDSS score of 0-5.0 and experienced either ≥1 relapse in the 12 months or had ≥1 gadolinium-enhanced lesion on brain MRI in the 6 weeks, before randomization. Data DEFINE and CONFIRM were pooled and analyzed using a negative binomial regression model (adjusted for study and region). Data obtained after subjects switched to an alternative MS therapy were not included in the analysis. Only relapses confirmed by the Independent Neurology Evaluation Committee were included in the analysis of relapses requiring IV steroids.
Findings
The study population (intention-to-treat) comprised 2301 patients who received either placebo (n = 771), DMF BID (n = 769), or DMF TID (n = 761). Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally well balanced among treatment groups. Throughout the 2-year studies, the total number of relapses treated with methylprednisolone was 402, 221, and 209 in the placebo, DMF BID, and DMF TID groups, respectively. A smaller proportion of patients in the DMF BID (168 of 769 [21.8%]) and DMF TID (151 of 761 [19.8%]) groups experienced ≥1 relapse requiring IV steroids compared with the placebo group (284 of 771 [36.8%]). The total number of MS-related hospitalizations over 2 years was 136, 94, and 74 in the placebo, DMF BID, and DMF TID groups. A smaller proportion of patients in the DMF BID (73 of 769 [9.5%]) and DMF TID (57 of 761 [7.5%]) groups had ≥1 MS-related hospitalization compared with the placebo group (104 of 771 [13.5%]).
Implications
DMF is an effective and well tolerated therapy for RRMS. In addition to clinical benefits, the use of DMF may be associated with reduced patient burden and health economic savings, resulting from a decrease in resource utilization associated with relapses.

Bronchodilator therapy is the keystone of improving COPD symptoms and functional capacity. The primary objective of this open-label study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of salmeterol 50 μg BID administered by metered-dose inhaler versus oral, titrated, sustained-release theophylline BID, both given for 3 months to patients with a clinical history of chronic bronchitis. The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety profile of the two drugs for an additional 9-month period and to assess changes in QOL both within and between treatment groups, using the 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey. One hundred seventy-eight outpatients (122 men, 56 women; mean age, 56 ± 12.9 years; mean body weight, 76.1 ± 11.8 kg) were randomized to the two treatment groups. Patients receiving salmeterol showed significant improvement in mean morning peak expiratory flow rate (16.56 L/min) over the 3-month period compared with patients receiving theophylline (P = 0.02). Salmeterol also significantly increased the percentage of symptom-free days and nights with no additional salbutamol requirement (P < 0.01). A significant difference was found between increases in forced expiratory volume in 1 second compared with baseline for salmeterol compared with theophylline throughout the initial 3-month period (0.13, 0.16, and 0.16 L at months 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and during the additional 9 months. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups (salmeterol, 49.5%; theophylline, 49.4%), with a lower percentage of pharmacologically predictable adverse events in patients receiving salmeterol (4%) compared with those receiving theophylline (14.8%). Both drugs improved QOL, as measured by effects on the eight aspects of life experience analyzed by the SF-36 questionnaire. Salmeterol therapy was effective in more aspects, and the improvements seen in each were numerically greater than those seen with theophylline therapy. Statistically different changes between the two treatment groups were reported for physical functioning, changes in health perception, and social functioning (P = 0.02, P = 0.03, and P = 0.004, respectively). These data suggest that inhaled salmeterol 50 μg BID was more effective and better tolerated than oral, titrated theophylline and allowed better long-term control of airways obstruction and symptoms with improved lung function in patients with COPD}

abstract = {Background
The efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) have been demonstrated in patients with asthma at least 12 years old.
Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of 2 formoterol doses added to budesonide as fixed combinations vs budesonide alone in children 6 to younger than 12 years with asthma.
Methods
This randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, multicenter study (NCT02091986; CHASE 3) included children 6 to younger than 12 years with asthma previously receiving a medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or an ICS plus a long-acting β2-agonist. Children symptomatic during a 7–28-day run-in on low-dose ICS, 1 inhalation of budesonide dry powder inhaler 90 μg twice daily (BID), were randomized to receive 2 inhalations of budesonide/formoterol pMDI 80/4.5 μg (160/9 μg) BID (n = 92), budesonide/formoterol pMDI 80/2.25 μg (160/4.5 μg) BID (n = 95), or budesonide pMDI 80 μg (160 μg) BID (n = 92) for 12 weeks.
Results
Change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second from baseline to 1 hour after dosing (primary end point), change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second 15 minutes after dosing, and peak expiratory flow 1 hour after dosing at week 12 were statistically significantly greater for budesonide/formoterol 160/9 μg vs budesonide (P ≤ .015 for all comparisons), but not for budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg vs budesonide. Bronchodilator effects, evident 15 minutes after the dose on day 1, were maintained at week 12. Incidence of protocol-defined asthma exacerbations and improvements in asthma symptom-related and quality-of-life outcomes were similar across treatments. There were no notable safety differences among treatments.
Conclusion
Budesonide/formoterol pMDI 160/9 μg showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful lung function improvements vs budesonide pMDI 160 μg, demonstrating appropriateness as a therapeutic option for children 6 to younger than 12 years with asthma symptomatic on ICS alone.

The study draws on the literature in keyword auction design, search advertising performance, and consumer search behavior as the theoretical foundation. The study finds a significant variation in the role of keyword competition for web-only versus multi-channel retailers. Specifically, this study finds that keyword competition has a significant moderating effect only for multi-channel retailers. The empirical analysis also indicates that the position of ads for web-only retailers is dependent on bid values and ad relevancy factors, whereas multi-channel retailers are more reliant on their bid values. We discuss the implications of these results in light of the increased popularity of sponsored search advertising in recent years.}

abstract = {Background:
Quality of life (QOL) is impaired in functional dyspepsia (FD). Little is known about the effects of different therapies on the QOL profile in patients with this condition.
Objectives:
The aims of this study were to measure baseline QOL in patients with FD and to assess changes in QOL over time associated with Helicobacter pylori eradication and prokinetic treatment. The primary and secondary end points were the improvement in QOL 6 weeks and 1 year after successful eradication of the infection or prokinetic therapy.
Methods:
This 1-year, single-center, prospective, open-label, controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted at the Department of Gastroenterology, Ferencvdros Health Centre, Budapest, Hungary. The Functional Digestive Disorder Quality of Life (FDDQoL) Questionnaire (MAPI Research Institute, Lyon, France) was translated and validated previously in Hungarian. Male and female subjects aged 20 to 60 years were enrolled and classified as H pylori positive (HP+), H pylori negative (HP-) with FD, or healthy (control group). The HP+ patients received pantoprazole 40 mg BID + amoxicillin 1000 mg BID + clarithromycin 500 mg BID for 7 days, followed by on-demand ranitidine (150–300 mg/d) for 1 year. The HP- patients received the prokinetic cisapride 10 mg TID for 1 month, followed by on-demand cisapride (10–20 mg/d) for 1 year. The FDDQoL questionnaire was completed by all 3 groups on enrollment, at 6 weeks, and 1 year.
Results:
A total of 101 HP+ patients, 98 HP- patients, and 123 healthy controls were included in the study (185 women, 137 men; mean age, 39.0 ears). The mean (SD) baseline QOL scores were significantly lower in the HP+ group (53.3 [9.6]; 95% CI, 54.4-58.2) and the HP- groups (50.0 [9.8]; 95% CI, 58.0–62.0) compared with that in healthy controls (76.2 [8.7]; 95% CI, 74.6–77.8) (both, P < 0.001). Analysis of the short-term domain scores found that the HP+ group had significantly decreased scores in 6 of 8 domains: daily activities (P = 0.005), anxiety level (P = 0.02), diet (P = 0.008), sleep (P < 0.001), discomfort (P = 0.004), and disease control (P = 0.02); the HP- group had significantly decreased scores in 5 of 8 domains: daily activities (P < 0.001), diet (P = 0.004), sleep (P = 0.005), discomfort (P < 0.001), and disease control (P = 0.02). Eradication of the infection was successful in 77/101 (76.2%) of the patients on intent-to-treat analysis and 77/94 (81.9%) on per-protocol analysis. Eradication was associated with an increase in mean (SD) QOL score to 70.8 (10.7) at 6 weeks (95% CI, 63.3–73.2; P < 0.001 vs baseline) and to 75.3 (9.3) at 1 year (95% CI, 73.2–77.5; P= 0.05 vs 6 weeks). In the HP- group, the QOL score increased to 73.3 (9.7) (95% CI, 71.3–75.4; P < 0.001 vs baseline) at 6 weeks of cisapride treatment and to 76.5 (8.5) at 1 year (95% CI, 74.5–78.4; P = 0.06 vs 6 weeks). Most of the impaired domain scores improved significantly after both treatments. The short-term effect size was 1.48 in HP+ and 1.35 in HP− patients. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 22 (21.8%) patients in the HP+ group (nausea, 8 [7.9%] patients; diarrhea, 5 [5.0%]; loss of appetite, 5 [5.0%]; stomatitis, 5 [5.0%]; abdominal pain, 4 [4.0%]; bloating, 4 [4.0%]; headache, 4 [4.0%]; vomiting, 4 [4.0%]; constipation, 3 [3.0%]; and vaginitis, 3 [3.0%]). In HP− cases, AEs occurred in 9 (9.2%) patients (abdominal cramps, 7 [7.1%]; diarrhea, 4 [4.1%]; and nausea, 3 [3.1%]).
Conclusion:
In this study in patients with FD and healthy controls, eradication of H pylori infection in infected patients and cisapride treatment in uninfected patients reversed low QOL scores during the 1-year follow-up period.}

abstract = {Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) causes irreversible loss of lung function. The lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA1) pathway is implicated in IPF etiology. Safety and efficacy of BMS-986020, a high-affinity LPA1 antagonist, was assessed vs placebo in a phase 2 study in patients with IPF.
Methods
IM136003 was a phase 2, parallel-arm, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Adults with IPF (FVC, 45%-90%; diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, 30%-80%) were randomized to receive placebo or 600 mg BMS-986020 (once daily [qd] or bid) for 26 weeks. The primary end point was rate of change in FVC from baseline to week 26.
Results
Of 143 randomized patients, 108 completed the 26-week dosing phase. Thirty-five patients discontinued prematurely. Patient baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups (placebo: n = 47; 600 mg qd: n = 48; 600 mg bid: n = 48). Patients treated with BMS-986020 bid experienced a significantly slower rate of decline in FVC vs placebo (−0.042 L; 95% CI, −0.106 to −0.022 vs −0.134 L; 95% CI, −0.201 to −0.068, respectively; P = .049). Dose-related elevations in hepatic enzymes were observed in both BMS-986020 treatment groups. The study was terminated early because of three cases of cholecystitis that were determined to be related to BMS-986020 after unblinding.
Conclusions
BMS-986020 600 mg bid treatment for 26 weeks vs placebo significantly slowed the rate of FVC decline. Both regimens of BMS-986020 were associated with elevations in hepatic enzymes.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of elagolix vs. placebo and elagolix with low-dose E2/progestogen add-back therapy.
Design
Proof-of-concept, dose-ranging, multiple-cohort study.
Setting
Clinics.
Patient(s)
Premenopausal women with fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding (menstrual blood loss [MBL] >80 mL per cycle).
Intervention(s)
Three months' treatment with elagolix alone: 100 mg twice daily (BID), 200 mg BID, 300 mg BID, 400 mg once daily (QD), or 600 mg QD (all but the 600 mg QD arm were placebo controlled); or elagolix plus add-back therapy: 200 mg BID plus continuous low-dose E2 0.5 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.1 mg or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2 1 mg continuously and cyclical P 200 mg.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Least-squares mean percentage change in MBL; adverse events (AEs).
Result(s)
Mean age was 41.8 years; 73.8% were black; mean baseline MBL was 267 mL. Of randomized women (elagolix alone, n = 160; placebo, n = 50; elagolix with add-back therapy, n = 61), 228 of 271 completed the 3-month treatment period. The MBL percentage change from baseline to last 28 days was significantly greater with elagolix alone (range, −72% to −98%; dose-dependent reduction was highest with 300 mg BID) vs. placebo (range, −8% to −41%); mean percentage changes with add-back regimens were −80% to −85%. Overall AEs were dose independent (elagolix alone, 70.0%–81.3%) but lower with placebo (56.0%) and add-back regimens (55.6%–70.6%). Hot flush was the most common AE (elagolix alone, 45.5%–62.5%; placebo, 12.0%; add-back regimens, 18.5%–26.5%).
Conclusion(s)
Elagolix significantly reduced heavy menstrual bleeding in women with fibroids. Low-dose add-back regimens substantially reduced flushing.

abstract = {Aim
Patients with heart failure (HF) have reduced exercise capacity. The beneficial effect of beta-blocker on prognosis is not matched by an impact on exercise capacity and quality of life. We performed a randomised open blinded endpoint study to assess the effect of heart rate reduction with carvedilol, ivabradine, and their combination on exercise capacity in HF patients receiving maximal dose of ACE inhibitor.
Methods and results
After a run-in phase patients were randomly allocated to 3 groups: carvedilol up to 25mg bid (n=38); ivabradine up to 7.5mg bid (n=41); and carvedilol/ivabradine up to 12.5/5mg bid (n=42). The maximal dose of study treatment was more frequently tolerated in patients receiving ivabradine (36/41) than in those receiving carvedilol (18/38) or combination therapy (32/42) (P<0.01 ivabradine versus carvedilol). Heart rate was reduced in all three groups, but to a greater extent by the combination. The distance walked on the 6-min walking test and the exercise time on MVO2 test significantly improved in the ivabradine and combination groups (both P<0.01 versus baseline), as did peak VO2 and VAT (P<0.01 for ivabradine and P<0.03 for combination versus carvedilol, respectively). No changes in these parameters were found with carvedilol. The patients receiving ivabradine or the combination had better quality of life (P<0.01 versus baseline for ivabradine and P<0.02 for combination), versus no change with carvedilol.
Conclusion
Ivabradine alone or in combination with carvedilol is more effective than carvedilol alone at improving exercise tolerance and quality of life in HF patients.}

abstract = {Background
Lorcaserin, a high-affinity 5-HT2C receptor agonist approved for treating obesity, decreased self-administration of oxycodone and cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior in preclinical studies. The current investigation is the first clinical trial to evaluate the ability of lorcaserin to alter the reinforcing and subjective effects of oxycodone.
Methods
In this 7-week inpatient trial, 12 non-treatment-seeking volunteers (11 males) with moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder were detoxified from opioids. In a randomized cross-over fashion, participants were first stabilized on lorcaserin (10 mg BID) or placebo (0 mg BID). Participants underwent a two-week testing period during which the reinforcing and subjective effects of intranasal oxycodone were examined in verbal choice, cue-exposure, and progressive-ratio choice sessions. The two testing weeks were identical with the exception that during the first week, active oxycodone (10 mg) was available during verbal choice (self-administration) sessions, and during the second week placebo oxycodone was available. Subsequently, participants were stabilized on the other medication condition (placebo or lorcaserin) and underwent the same testing procedures again.
Results
Lorcaserin did not alter oxycodone self-administration. However, lorcaserin had a trend to increase “wanting heroin” when oxycodone was available, and to accentuate oxycodone-induced miosis.
Conclusion
Under the current experimental conditions, lorcaserin at a dose of 10 mg BID did not reliably decrease the abuse liability of oxycodone, even though the study was sufficiently powered (≥80 %) to detect clinically meaningful differences in the main outcome variables between the placebo and active lorcaserin condition. Future research could explore a wider dose range of lorcaserin and oxycodone.}

Our empirical analysis shows that Treasury security trading costs increase as the close of trading approaches, consistent with model predictions.}

Our estimates imply that target resistance explains the entire magnitude of the premium in 74% of successful single-bidder contests. Simulation experiments show that initial bidders have, on average, a higher valuation for the target than rival bidders, so that a relatively low initial bid is sufficient to deter a rival from entry.}

This paper demonstrates a way to add real-time interactions to oTree and presents two ready-made apps: a double auction and a gift exchange with a real effort task. Many auction designs, including the double auction, use time constraints and carry out sales as soon as an ask and a bid are compatible. Instantaneous flow of information is thus a core requirement for programming these auctions in the first place. The real effort task measuring the number of correct answers within a time limit, on the other hand, benefits from the extra flexibility and security that Django Channels provides. Furthermore, real effort tasks are a simple starting point for building real-time interaction apps with oTree.}

We design auction mechanisms with and without an entry fee and define utility functions based on the total achieved capacity per unit price. We equip the CRs with a learning algorithm in order to bid more efficiently. Our considered network consists of a central spectrum moderator (CSM) and a number of competing CR pairs. The CSM auctions the available spectrum bands, and each CR bids for them in order to transmit its data. A CR bids for a subcarrier at a value proportional to the achievable capacity for it to transmit on that subcarrier, and the CR is free to dynamically assign portions of its transmit power to available subcarriers in order to maximize its achievable capacity per unit of price. We propose a Dirichlet process-based and a Gaussian process regression-based learning algorithms which make use of the outcomes of the past auctions to learn the bidding behavior of the competing CRs. By learning the bidding behavior of competing CRs, a CR can improve its bidding efficiency by concentrating its transmit power on the subcarriers that it has a higher chance of getting access to. Simulation results show that the proposed nonparametric learning algorithms achieve significantly higher utilities for the CRs than the myopic approach, and both the Dirichlet and the Gaussian processes provide roughly the same level of improvement.}

The findings are robust to a battery of different bid prices. We also document that retail investor oversubscription ratio is negatively or not associated with pre-IPO accrual-based EM. However, such oversubscription ratio is positively correlated with pre-IPO real EM. Additional results show that IPO offer prices (relative to the proposed IPO price range) are negatively correlated with pre-IPO EM, suggesting that institutional investors’ ability to recognize EM pressures IPO issuing firms into setting a lower offer price.

Advanced ages, alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, and obesity were associated with BID due to being HI. We must consider different public health interventions for men and women to reduce BID in Brazilian adults.}

Violation of this sorting condition creates opportunities for Pareto-improving trading of locations and can be sustained only if the market is hindered. We propose a simple ordered-location-choice model using matched location and location-preference data of individual households to examine violations of the Pareto-efficient spatial sorting condition. In so doing we are able to identify population groups facing housing-choice hindrances. We find in a sample of Chinese cities undergoing housing market liberalization that poor marketability of the previously state-provided homes, inadequate provision of housing finance, and spatial mismatch between job-market and housing-market opportunities contribute to a Pareto-inefficient spatial structure.}

abstract = {Background
Two different regimens of enoxaparin (40 mg once daily or 30 mg bid) have been used as control arms in trials of new oral anticoagulants. The choice of enoxaparin comparator may influence the perceived relative efficacy and safety of the newer agents, and we aimed to identify any significant differences between the two enoxaparin regimens.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials that compared enoxaparin to oral anticoagulant (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban) thromboprophylaxis in elective total knee or hip arthroplasty. Total VTE and bleeding events were pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessed with the I2 statistic. We conducted adjusted indirect comparisons of bid vs once-daily enoxaparin regimes based on new oral anticoagulants as common comparators.
Results
Fourteen randomized controlled trials in hip and knee replacement surgery met the inclusion criteria. Adjusted indirect comparison showed that bid enoxaparin was significantly more effective in preventing VTE than enoxaparin once daily (relative risk [RR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-0.83; P < .00001). For major and clinically relevant hemorrhage, adjusted indirect comparison showed that enoxaparin bid was nonsignificantly associated with increased risk of bleeding (RR 1.27; 95% CI, 0.97-1.65; P = .08) above that of enoxaparin once daily. Subgroup analysis limited to total knee arthroplasty trials showed similar results.
Conclusions
The use of once-daily enoxaparin regimen as control in clinical trials will lead to more favorable estimates of relative efficacy for the new oral anticoagulants than if enoxaparin 30 mg bid had been chosen as a comparator.}

Investors’ dynamic hedging demand coincides with covariance risk, which in turn plays a central role in explaining contemporaneous time-variation in expected market returns. Our model predictions are consistent with variations in expected equity and bond returns that include flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out episodes, both of which coincide with low levels of equity-bond covariance. We identify determinants of time-variation in conditional covariance and thus potential drivers of flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out. Unanticipated changes in expected inflation, market illiquidity and stock market uncertainty predict changes in the equity-bond covariance, where the contribution of each variable is state-dependent. In particular, the non-linear effects of shocks to inflation act as a key driver.}

We apply event study methodology on a sample of 2137 cross-border M&As from 1986 to 2009 to test our hypothesis. Consistent with our proposition, we find that bidders fare better in acquisitions of divested assets. Our various market-based measures of performance are overwhelmingly in favor of these kinds of acquirers. Consistent with the wealth effects, we also find that the cost of capital charged to buyers of divisions/subsidiaries/assets of an organization is lower compared to buyers of whole/parent corporations abroad. Overall, our findings suggest that bidders who are in a position to bid for specific divisions or subsidiaries or assets of a foreign corporation rather than acquire the whole corporation can extract larger benefits.}

The probability of payment of the bid price by the auctioneer is estimated by each bidder. For a first and a second price auction, we derive equilibrium bidding strategies, which address the risk of default and optimally adjust the bid price, introducing a risk premium in the form of an additional mark-up. A numerical illustration of the proposed strategies is provided. The effect of auctioneer׳s risk of default on the procurement project cost is examined. Financial arrangements that may be used to relax or eliminate the effect of the risk of default, such as early payment methods, third party guarantees or insurance programs are discussed and evaluated in comparison with the approach of risk premium on bid price.}

Moreover, my analysis shows that sellers making fixed price offers invest in a good reputation to a similar extent as buyers pay for it in auctions. Finally, I obtain repeated observations on a considerable subset of the buyer population by including highest non-winning bids in the analysis and show that buyers trade off sellers’ reputations and prices within the set of offered items they choose to bid on. My findings provide further evidence that reputation systems solve trust problems and reduce transaction costs in anonymous online markets by providing incentives for traders’ cooperative behavior.}

We extend prior research that finds a positive association between integrated report quality (IRQ) and firm value by examining two channels through which this association may arise—a capital market channel and a real effects channel. To conduct these tests, we disaggregate firm value into three components: liquidity, cost of capital, and expected future cash flows. Using data from South Africa where integrated reporting is mandatory and an IRQ measure based on proprietary EY data, we find a positive association between IRQ and liquidity, which supports the capital market channel. We find no evidence of a relation between IRQ and cost of capital. We also find a positive association between IRQ and expected future cash flows. Because this association could reflect better investor cash flow forecasts—a capital market effect, better internal decisions—a real effect, or both, we attempt to distinguish these explanations. We find higher IRQ is (not) associated with higher realized future operating cash flows (greater analyst target price forecast accuracy), and find higher IRQ is associated with higher investment efficiency. These findings support the real effects channel. Together, our findings are consistent with integrated reporting achieving its dual objective of improved external information and better internal decisions.}

The paper's theoretical and empirical analysis is unusually complete in that it considers the entire process of collective action, including participation in initial organization, voting, and ultimate impact on property values. BID benefits are shown to be highly uneven, and BID formation is not a Pareto improvement. Furthermore, large “anchor participants” benefit disproportionately, and are crucial for the viability of the institution, consistent with Olson (1965). These results, while demonstrated in a particular setting, apply to collective action more generally. Whenever a market failure leaves room for a collective response, the presence of anchor participants encourages collective action, and the action – even though in a sense voluntary – has uneven benefits.}

Regression method is used to analyse the data. This study finds that the price efficiency of PP is negatively associated with the implementation of green public procurement (GPP) but is positively associated with the evaluation method (the weight of bidding price during evaluation) and the number of bidders. Time efficiency is negatively associated with GPP implementation. Intellectual efficiency is negatively associated with the size of the procurement.

To assess the analytical performance of instruments and methods through external quality assessment and proficiency testing data on the Sigma scale.
Design and methods
A representative report from five different EQA/PT programs around the world (2 US, 1 Canadian, 1 UK, and 1 Australasian) was accessed. The instrument group standard deviations were used as surrogate estimates of instrument imprecision. Performance specifications from the US CLIA proficiency testing criteria were used to establish a common quality goal. Then Sigma-metrics were calculated to grade the analytical performance.
Results
Different methods have different Sigma-metrics for each analyte reviewed. Summary Sigma-metrics estimate the percentage of the chemistry analytes that are expected to perform above Five Sigma, which is where optimized QC design can be implemented. The range of performance varies from 37% to 88%, exhibiting significant differentiation between instruments and manufacturers. Median Sigmas for the different manufacturers in three analytes (albumin, glucose, sodium) showed significant differentiation.
Conclusions
Chemistry tests are not commodities. Quality varies significantly from manufacturer to manufacturer, instrument to instrument, and method to method. The Sigma-assessments from multiple EQA/PT programs provide more insight into the performance of methods and instruments than any single program by itself. It is possible to produce a ranking of performance by manufacturer, instrument and individual method. Laboratories seeking optimal instrumentation would do well to consult this data as part of their decision-making process. To confirm that these assessments are stable and reliable, a longer term study should be conducted that examines more results over a longer time period.}

Fluticasone propionate is a potent inhaled corticosteroid that is effective in improving pulmonary function and symptoms in patients with asthma.
Objective
To evaluate the effects of fluticasone propionate on quality of life in patients with severe asthma requiring oral corticosteroids.
Methods
A total of 96 patients with severe asthma participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, oral steroid-sparing study. Patients received fluticasone propionate aerosol, 750 or 1,000 μg bid, or placebo for 16 weeks; 91 of these patients continued in a 1-year open-label study, in which everyone initially received fluticasone propionate, 1,000 μg bid. At regular intervals, patients completed the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36), a general health status questionnaire measuring 8 dimensions of quality of life, plus one question on change in health from the previous year.
Results
Compared with the US population, patients scored significantly lower at baseline for five of eight SF-36 dimensions (P ≤ .01). After 16 weeks, patients receiving fluticasone propionate 1,000 μg, improved significantly (P ≤ .02) in physical functioning, rolephysical, general health, and change in health, compared with the placebo group. After 1 year of open-label treatment with fluticasone propionate, these improvements were maintained. SF-36 scores in the placebo group during the double-blind period either worsened or remained unchanged; however, when these patients were switched to fluticasone propionate during the open-label period, their SF-36 scores also improved. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at the end of the double-blind period was positively correlated with mean quality of life scores on physical functioning, role-physical, vitality, social functioning, and change-in-health status.
Conclusion
Health-related quality of life improved in patients with severe asthma following 16 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate, 1,000 μg bid. These improvements were maintained during subsequent fluticasone propionate treatment over a 1-year period.}

abstract = {Much of the existing auction literature treats auctions as running independently of one another, with each bidder choosing to participate in only one auction. However, in many online auctions, a number of substitutable goods are auctioned concurrently and bidders can bid on several auctions at the same time. Recent theoretical research shows how bidders can gain from the existence of competing auctions, the current paper providing the first empirical evidence in support of competing auctions theory using online auctions data from eBay. Our results indicate that a significant proportion of bidders do bid across competing auctions and that bidders tend to submit bids on auctions with the lowest standing bid, as the theory predicts. The paper also shows that winning bidders who cross-bid pay lower prices on average than winning bidders who do not.}

abstract = {Image segmentation is one of the fundamental techniques in image analysis. One group of segmentation techniques is based on clustering principles, where association of image pixels is based on a similarity criterion. Conventional clustering algorithms, such as k-means, can be used for this purpose but have several drawbacks including dependence on initialisation conditions and a higher likelihood of converging to local rather than global optima. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based image segmentation method that is based on the human mental search (HMS) algorithm. HMS is a recent metaheuristic algorithm based on the manner of searching in the space of online auctions. In HMS, each candidate solution is called a bid, and the algorithm comprises three major stages: mental search, which explores the vicinity of a solution using Levy flight to find better solutions; grouping which places a set of candidate solutions into a group using a clustering algorithm; and moving bids toward promising solution areas. In our image clustering application, bids encode the cluster centres and we evaluate three different objective functions. In an extensive set of experiments, we compare the efficacy of our proposed approach with several state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms including a genetic algorithm, differential evolution, particle swarm optimisation, artificial bee colony algorithm, and harmony search. We assess the techniques based on a variety of metrics including the objective functions, a cluster validity index, as well as unsupervised and supervised image segmentation criteria. Moreover, we perform some tests in higher dimensions, and conduct a statistical analysis to compare our proposed method to its competitors. The obtained results clearly show that the proposed algorithm represents a highly effective approach to image clustering that outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques.}
