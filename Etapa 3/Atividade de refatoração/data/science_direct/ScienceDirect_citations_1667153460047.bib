abstract = {Can companies reduce the volatility and increase the liquidity of their stocks by trading them? In the context of the Italian stock market, where companies have far more leeway to sell as well as buy their own stocks than in the U.S., the answer is yes. We examine the effects of trading (open-market share repurchases and treasury shares sales) on liquidity (bid–ask spread) and volatility (return variance). Further, we examine the impact of shareholder approvals of repurchase programs on liquidity and volatility. We find clear evidence that trading increases liquidity and reduces volatility. These results are consistent with our analysis of the motives Italian companies give for making share repurchases.}

We investigate the costumers’ specifications concerning trams and we try to respond whether they can be applied in a universal assessment procedure for trams to be used in urban, public transportation systems, based on the principles of Multiple Criteria Decision Making/ Aiding (MCDM/A). The analysis of trams is formulated as a multiple criteria ranking problem. The proposed paradigm includes: the definition of the group decision maker – DM and stakeholders, selection of variants (trams), formulation of the consistent family of criteria, recognition and modeling of the DM and stakeholders’ interests/ preferences, performance of the computational experiments, generation of the ranking of trams. We perform a series of computational experiments with an application of selected multiple criteria ranking methods (ELECTRE III/IV, AHP). The generated rankings result in a comprehensive analysis of the quality of trams in different countries and the suitability of selected MCDM/A methods for the evaluation of trams.}

A fair evaluation of paper is key to an author's success, paper quality, conference reputation, and productive usage of funds. Recent studies reflect on the issue of reviewer bias in bids favoring authors belonging to the top institution and higher authority. Existing Conference Management Systems (CMS) are solely dependent upon self-declared Conflict of Interest (CoI) made by the authors, and reviewers. In literature, existing studies considers topic similarity, potential CoI, and reviewer's workload as trivial factors for ensuring review quality. Other factors include the diversity and authority of a reviewer. Past studies propose several theoretical optimization models. In this paper, we first individually model the factors using the best possible strategy in a constrained-based optimization framework. We tried to propose a completely novel framework that can be practically implemented to improve upon the performance of existing CMS. We map the RAP to an equilibrium multi-job assignment problem. Moreover, we propose a meta-heuristic greedy solution to solve it using weighted matrix factorization. We re-define an assignment quality metric required to validate such assignments. A real conference assignment data set collected from EasyChair is used for a comparative study. The TPMS is used as a baseline because it also uses similar factors, and due to its integration with widely used Microsoft CMS. The results show that the mean assignment quality of the proposed method is superior to other benchmark RAP systems.}

In this work, we design mechanisms that are both incentive compatible and computationally feasible for these environments. Since the underlying algorithmic problem is computationally hard, these mechanisms cannot always achieve the optimal welfare; Nevertheless, they do guarantee a fraction of the optimal solution. We differentiate between two information models—when both the desired figures and their values are unknown to the auctioneer or when only the agents' values are private data. We guarantee different fractions of the optimal welfare for each information model and for different families of figures (e.g., arbitrary convex figures or axis-aligned rectangles). We suggest using a measure on the geometric diversity of the figures for expressing the quality of the approximations that our mechanisms provide.}

The key challenge is deciding on the types of keywords to bid on and matching options to utilise for the keywords. In this paper, we address this problem by providing a broad analysis on how the various traffic search metrics (length, CTR, average cost per click (CPC), average position, and quality score) influence the bidding results as the keyword matching option becomes broader, that is, from exact, to phrase to broad. Drawing on the shopping goals theory, we also establish the profile of the metrics associated with a more focused search intent across the matching options. Using a random sample of keywords selected from 9 640 keywords that online advertisers have bid on, spanning a variety of markets, the results indicate that as the matching option becomes narrower, that is, from broad to exact, the keyword traffic metrics increase in general, except for cost, which does not differ significantly across the matching options. Longer keywords, which are typically associated with a more focussed search intent, generate more clicks and have a higher quality measure on average across all matching options. The longer keywords are cheaper for the exact match option, but more expensive for the other matching options. The results are inconclusive with regard to the position that longer keywords occupy on a results page across the matching options. Thus, the narrower matching options and longer keywords matching those that a customer would typically use to search for a company's goods and services need to be targeted to ensure higher visits to a company's website.}

The half-life of everolimus is approximately 28 hours, but everolimus is normally administered twice a day. The aim of this prospective, single-center, exploratory study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a once a day (OD) everolimus regimen versus the standard twice a day regimen (BID) for immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation.
Methods
Forty de novo renal transplant recipients prospectively assigned to OD (n = 21) or BID (n = 19) were followed for 6 months. In the OD group, everolimus was given orally once a day to target a trough blood level of 2–6 ng/mL. In the BID, group everolimus was given twice a day to target a trough blood level of 3–12 ng/mL. All patients also received induction treatment with basiliximab and low-dose calcineurin inhibitors.
Results
At 6 months follow-up, patient and graft survivals were 100%; renal function and acute rejection rates were similar between the 2 regimens. Patients in the OD group showed significantly lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared with those in the BID group, namely, total cholesterol level, OD 212 ± 54 versus BID 249 ± 59 mg/dL (P < .05), and serum triglycerides, OD 162 ± 72 versus BID 245 ± 133 mg/dL (P < .02).
Discussion
This study showed that OD administration of everolimus provided excellent patient and graft survivals and good renal function without an increased incidence of acute rejection episodes. The lipid profile was significantly better among patients receiving everolimus OD. These findings suggested that everolimus can be safely administered once a day.}

The study found higher support for reclaimed water among those who had higher incomes, were male, and rented their homes. In addition, those who supported reclaimed water use policy and believed that reclaimed water is not hazardous were willing to pay more for reclaimed water to conserve municipal supplies. A subset of respondents viewed detailed technical quality data on bacterial standards for reclaimed water versus recreational water bodies; rather than reassuring respondents of the higher quality of reclaimed water, this information made respondents less likely to accept the reclaimed water bid. On average, respondents were willing to pay on average $4.20 and $3.47 per 1000gallons more than current rates for reclaimed water to preserve municipal water supply in the two models estimated without and with the attitudinal variables, respectively.}

To reduce side effects and maximize efficacy, nintedanib was reformulated as a solution for nebulization and inhaled administration. To predict effectiveness treating IPF, inhalation was used as a tool to dissect the pharmacokinetic components required for nintedanib pulmonary anti-fibrotic activity. Following oral administration, nintedanib extensively partitioned into tissue and exhibited flip-flop pharmacokinetics, whereby resulting lung Cmax and AUC were substantially higher than plasma. By comparison, inhaled nintedanib was capable of delivering an oral-equivalent lung Cmax with lower local and systemic AUC. Using a multi-challenge bleomycin rat model, this distinct inhaled pharmacokinetic profile was dose responsive (0.05, 0.25 and 0.375 mg/kg), delivering oral-superior pulmonary anti-fibrotic activity with an equivalent delivered lung Cmax (QD inhaled 0.375 mg/kg versus BID oral 60 mg/kg). Possibly assisting this improvement, the infrequent high inhaled dose also improved bleomycin-challenged animal weight gain to levels equivalent to sham. By comparison, BID oral weight gain was substantially less than controls, suggesting a negative health impact on oral administered animals combating fibrosis. Both oral and inhaled administration exhibited anti-inflammatory activity, with oral achieving significance. In summary, inhalation (short-duration nintedanib lung Cmax without high local or systemic AUC) was well-tolerated and was effective reducing bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.}

abstract = {Background
Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor that improves clinical measures of psoriasis.
Objective
We sought to assess patient-reported outcomes in tofacitinib-treated patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis over 52 weeks.
Methods
In 2 identical, phase III studies (Oral treatment for Psoriasis Trial Pivotal 1 [NCT01276639], n = 901, and Pivotal 2 [NCT01309737], n = 960), patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive 5 or 10 mg of tofacitinib or placebo, twice daily. At week 16, placebo-treated patients were re-randomized to tofacitinib. Dermatology Life Quality Index score, Itch Severity Item score, Patient Global Assessment score, and patient satisfaction were assessed.
Results
Baseline Dermatology Life Quality Index score indicated substantial health-related quality of life impairment. At week 16, a greater proportion of patients achieved Dermatology Life Quality Index score of 1 or less (no effect of psoriasis on health-related quality of life) with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg twice daily versus placebo (Oral treatment for Psoriasis Trial Pivotal 1/2: 26.7%/28.6% and 40.2%/48.2% vs 4.6%/6.0%, respectively; P < .0001); improvements were maintained through week 52. Similar patterns were observed with Patient Global Assessment. Improvements in itch were particularly rapid, observed 1 day after treatment initiation for both tofacitinib doses versus placebo (P < .05). At week 16, more patients were satisfied with tofacitinib versus placebo (P < .0001).
Limitations
Clinical nonresponders discontinued at week 28.
Conclusions
Tofacitinib demonstrated improvement in health-related quality of life and patient-reported symptoms that persisted over 52 weeks.}

Using an established experimental auction study design, parents viewed replicated McDonald's menus according to their assigned condition and were asked to bid on 4 Happy Meals. A randomly selected price was chosen; bids equal to or above this price “won” the auction, and bids less than this price “lost” the auction. After the auction, participants were asked to identify the Happy Meal with the highest calories and sodium content. Adjusting for multiple comparisons and covariates, the Calories, Sodium, + CS menu had a mean attributed value across all 4 Happy Meals which was 8% lower (−$0.31) than the Calories + CS menu (p < 0.05). Significantly more parents in the 4 menu conditions providing calories were able to correctly identify the Happy Meal with the highest calories (p < 0.0001) and significantly more parents in the 2 conditions providing sodium information were able to correctly identify the Happy Meal with the highest sodium content (p < 0.0001).

We show that asymmetric liquidity (quote demand vs. supply) better explains the asymmetric volatility observed in high-frequency data than trade information does. Ask-depth share plays a dominant role in asymmetric volatility, while order flow (sell-initiated volume share) makes a far smaller contribution.}

abstract = {Buying organizations are increasingly using electronic reverse auctions (eRAs) to source from suppliers. However, recent quasi-experimental and field research has suggested that the use of this sourcing technique can create perceptions of opportunism among participating suppliers. Yet from the buyer's perspective, online reverse auctions can yield lower purchase prices. Given the many ways in which to configure on-line auctions, we extend existing research by using a laboratory experiment to investigate how different reverse auction configurations jointly influence bid price and suppliers’ perceptions of buyer opportunism. Our findings suggest that supplier bid prices decrease over time as they participate in more eRAs, regardless of the configuration of auction parameters. However, the combination of rank (versus price) visibility, high (versus low) supplier need to win a contract, and six (versus three) competitors was significantly more effective than other combinations of variables in immediately reducing bid prices. The data also indicated that when suppliers’ bids dropped substantially across auctions, their perceptions of opportunism increased. Notably, auction parameter combinations such as price visibility, three competitors, and low need for the contract yielded comparably low bids by the third auction, without any increases in perceived buyer opportunism.}

Ensuring the accuracy of tissue classification is important for quality research and, in particular, the translation of imaging biomarkers to clinical practice. Assessment with the human eye is vital to correct various errors inherent to all currently available segmentation algorithms. Manual quality assurance becomes methodologically difficult at a large scale - a problem of increasing importance as the number of data sets is on the rise. To make this process more efficient, we have developed Mindcontrol, an open-source web application for the collaborative quality control of neuroimaging processing outputs. The Mindcontrol platform consists of a dashboard to organize data, descriptive visualizations to explore the data, an imaging viewer, and an in-browser annotation and editing toolbox for data curation and quality control. Mindcontrol is flexible and can be configured for the outputs of any software package in any data organization structure. Example configurations for three large, open-source datasets are presented: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP), the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Collection. These demo applications link descriptive quality control metrics, regional brain volumes, and thickness scalars to a 3D imaging viewer and editing module, resulting in an easy-to-implement quality control protocol that can be scaled for any size and complexity of study.}

Acquisitions with the same means of payment but different sources of transaction funding are in fact quite distinct. Acquisitions financed with internally generated funds significantly underperform those financed with debt. The takeover financing decision is influenced by the bidder's pecking order preferences, its growth potential, and its corporate governance environment, all of which are related to the cost of external capital. The choice of equity versus internal cash or debt financing also depends on the bidder's strategic preferences with respect to the means of payment.}

In many parts of the world governments are now considering strategies to restore environmental flows. One strategy is for a government to buyback water from irrigators for the environment with annual lease arrangements. In this paper we have studied the role of market competition (in terms of environmental water demand and number of sellers) in determining the performance of multi-round environmental water buyback auctions using a stylized agent based simulation model. The results suggest that rent extraction lowers as the number of bidders increase and water demand decreases. However, we find significant differences in the way changes in demand and supply influence rent extraction. Reduction in water demand has much greater impact on rent extraction than increasing the number of bidders in the market. Further, in wet years (when supply is abundant relative to demand) bidders engage in more competitive bidding compared to cases in dry years. Results from the analysis indicate that government agencies benefit more from arranging buyback tenders (1) with a small target relative to tenders with a large bidder population and (2) with greater opportunities for the bidders to learn from the market in wet years compared to dry years.}

The half-life of everolimus is approximately 28 hours, but everolimus is generally administered twice a day. The aim of this prospective, single-center, exploratory study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a once a day everolimus (OD) with the standard twice a day administration regimen (BID) as immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation.
Methods
Forty-one de novo renal transplant recipients prospectively assigned to OD (n = 21) or BID (n = 20) treatment were followed for 1 year. In the OD group, everolimus was orally administered targeting a trough blood level of 2 to 5 ng/mL. In the BID group, everolimus was given twice a day targeting a trough blood level of 3 to 12 ng/mL. All patients also received induction with basiliximab and low-dose calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppression.
Results
At 1 year follow-up patient and graft survivals were 100%. The intention-to-treat analysis showed similar renal function between the two regimens: serum creatinine values for OD 1.54 ± 0.6 versus BID 1.48 ± 0.53 mg/dL (P = NS). Also the occurrence of acute rejection episodes was not significantly different: 4.8% in the OD versus 15% in the BID group, (P = NS). The median trough blood levels were significantly lower among the OD group: OD 4.5 versus BID 7.2 ng/mL (P < .001).
Discussion
This study demonstrated that once a day administration of everolimus achieved excellent patient and graft survival and good renal function without an increased incidence of acute rejection episodes.}

However, the combination of areas to form bundles can provide economy of scale that is not seen otherwise. We highlight some issues regarding the current allocation system and we analyse the effectiveness of different bundling systems in maximizing government revenues and enhancing bidders' competitiveness. We use actual forest data to evaluate different rules and strategies for the creation and allocation of partial and full bundles. Our results suggest that the use of the option of bundling forests areas makes the auction process more beneficial to the majority of stakeholders: Government revenues are increased; the bidding companies are more likely to obtain the desired volumes and pay less for harvesting and equipment relocation; and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.}

abstract = {Background
Prevention of exacerbations is a primary goal for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) therapy. This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter study evaluated the effect of budesonide/formoterol pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) versus formoterol dry powder inhaler (DPI) on reducing COPD exacerbations.
Methods
1219 patients aged ≥40 years with moderate-to-very-severe COPD (per lung function) and a history of ≥1 COPD exacerbation received budesonide/formoterol pMDI 320/9 μg twice daily (BID) during a 4-week run-in. Patients were then randomized 1:1 to receive budesonide/formoterol pMDI 320/9 μg BID (n = 606) or formoterol DPI 9 μg BID (n = 613) for 26 weeks. Exacerbations were identified using predefined criteria for symptom worsening and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalization. The primary endpoint was annual rate of exacerbations.
Results
Budesonide/formoterol pMDI resulted in a 24% reduction in annual rate of exacerbations (0.85 vs 1.12; rate ratio: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.62, 0.92]; P = 0.006), and a significant risk reduction for time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.96]; P = 0.016) versus formoterol DPI. The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs; ≥3%) in budesonide/formoterol and formoterol groups were COPD (4.5% vs 8.6%) and nasopharyngitis (5.0% vs 5.2%). Pneumonia AEs were reported in 0.5% and 1.0% of budesonide/formoterol-treated and formoterol-treated patients, respectively.
Conclusions
Budesonide/formoterol pMDI is an effective treatment option for reducing exacerbation rates in COPD patients with moderate-to-very-severe airflow limitation and history of exacerbations. No increase in pneumonia was observed with budesonide/formoterol; safety data were consistent with its established profile.}

An instruction to bidders is a summary of the bidding procedure and the requirements of the bid. It is more detailed than the advertisement and contains information on preparing and submitting the bid, on bid bonds, on performance and payment bonds, and on the methods of evaluating responsive bids, as well as a schedule and procedure for awarding the contract and proceeding with the work. Technical specifications provide a detailed description of the scope of work, project-specific administrative and procedural requirements, type and quality of materials, performance of equipment and systems, and the level of workmanship expected of the contractor. The specification sections typically are grouped into separate, numbered divisions by type of product and construction specialty, following the format recommended by the Construction Specification Institute (CSI). The performance specifications describe the functional result that a product must achieve without identifying any specific material or product. A functional result specification usually places the burden of some design work on the contractor. Acceptance of the product might not be ensured until it is demonstrated that it could perform the intended function.}

Risk assessment and management as integrated part of actual market negotiation strategies is lacking from the current literature. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel model for decision support of players’ strategic participation in electricity market negotiations, which considers risk management as a core component of the decision-making process. The proposed approach addresses the adaptation of players’ behaviour according to the participation risk, by combining the two most commonly used approaches of forecasting in a company’s scope: the internal data analysis, and the external, or sectorial, data analysis. The internal data analysis considers the evaluation of the company’s evolution in terms of market power and profitability, while the sectorial analysis addresses the assessment of the competing entities in the market sector using a K-Means-based clustering approach. By balancing these two components, the proposed model enables a dynamic adaptation to the market context, using as reference the expected prices from competitor players, and the market price prediction by means of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Results under realistic electricity market simulations using real data from the Iberian electricity market operator show that the proposed approach is able to outperform most state-of-the-art market participation strategies, reaching a higher accumulated profit, by adapting players’ actions according to the participation risk.}

In countries with energy-intensive industries, flexibility may be increased through industrial demand side management (IDSM). In most studies, the potential of IDSM is estimated from a technical or theoretical viewpoint. However, IDSM capacity is only utilized if the industry finds it profitable, and thus the economic potential should also be assessed. The focus of this paper is on the intra-day IDSM potential of a paper mill site that is active in the Nordic power market. An optimization model is built to estimate the costs that occur when the paper mill executes regulating power bids, if the original production schedule has been optimized against a spot price forecast. The costs are estimated for different sizes of bids and a marginal cost curve is provided for pricing them. Using this marginal cost curve, the market potential of the case mill site is assessed. It is found that this potential is greatly influenced by the costs of executing regulating power bids. The results indicate that transmission system operators and policy makers should account for economic factors when assessing the potential of market based IDSM.}

The suppliers’ optimal bidding strategies are discussed, and a bidding method named the minimum bid increment method is proposed to simulate the overall process of suppliers’ multiple rounds of bidding. Theoretical analysis shows that our auction mechanism is an efficient mechanism, and satisfies the incentive compatibility conditions and the individual rationality conditions. Moreover, a multi-attribute auction example about the steam coal procurement is given to show how to implement our multi-attribute auction mechanism.}

Our analyses yield the following findings. Institutional investors have a lower level of trading aggressiveness than individuals. In terms of order immediacy, investment trusts and foreign investors tend to pay higher (lower) prices to buy (sell) stocks. Professional institutions spend much shorter time completing trades per order (<6 min), but obtain higher fill rates (about 99%) than other institutions and individuals. In addition, professional institutions tend to make smart decisions, earning profits for buy orders while reducing losses for sell orders.}

Information about exact dates of program enrollment is analyzed to show whether the first-come-first-served assignment rule randomized eligible individuals across courses of varying quality. Generalized propensity score (GPS) is implemented to estimate dose–response functions in the context of multiple treatments. We find that beneficiaries attending high-quality training courses show higher earnings and better job-quality characteristics than either beneficiaries attending low-quality courses or nonparticipants. The returns are particularly robust for women, making the provision of high-quality training services cost-effective. Furthermore, the most important training attribute is expenditures per trainee. Class size and infrastructure are weakly related to the expected impacts, while teacher experience, curricular activities, and market knowledge seem to bear no relationship with the expected impacts. External validity was assessed by using five cohorts of individuals over an eight-year period.}

Government ownership has significant and positive impacts on bid-ask spread during the period 1995–2000, but disappears afterward during 2001–2003. The finding that state ownership raised bid-ask spread in the early period is consistent with recent studies on emerging markets including China, which indicate that firms with higher state ownership tend to have a greater deviation between cash flow rights and control rights (eg, Wei et al., 2005). This implies that lower state ownership is associated with lower information asymmetry in the market, an economic consequence of significant economic reform and privatization regarding the market microstructure. However, with more active control transfers and emergence of private controlling shareholders, regulatory changes in ownership structure and corporate governance mechanisms, and thus an improved legal and institutional environment, the link between the government ownership and information asymmetry turns to be insignificant in the later period. These results have important implications for transparency and information disclosure policies as well as privatization in emerging markets.}

The current method is to develop BIM-R applications separately and represent the rules by coding or using proprietary formats, which has the problems of cost and efficiency. To solve these problems, a new method is proposed: to use a platform to rapidly develop BIM-R applications (BIM-R platform) based on ontology and freeware components. Thus, a BIM-R platform must be developed. This study establishes: 1) the functional requirements of the BIM-R platform, 2) the mechanism to transform BIM data into ontology data, and 3) the architecture of the BIM-R platform. This study also selects freeware components to develop the BIM-R platform. A BIM-R platform is implemented accordingly and applied to develop a prototype BIM-R application for the as-bid cost estimation of buildings for illustration. It is concluded that the proposed platform can help reduce the cost and improve the efficiency for the development of BIM-R applications and can be used by both researchers and developers.}

To assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and willingness to pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) amount of patients with epilepsy in China.
Methods
Adults with epilepsy and a healthy control were recruited in two tertiary hospitals in China. Participants completed two indirect utility elicitation instruments (Quality of Well-being Scale-self administered version and EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire) and a WTP questionnaire. Correlations between sociodemographic or epilepsy-specific variables (age of epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, seizure types, types of antiepileptic drug treatment, etc.) and HRQOL or WTP/QALY were assessed to identify the candidate predictor. Multiple linear regression models were adopted to investigate the predictive performances of identified candidate predictors. Data analyses were performed on SPSS 20.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).
Results
For utilities of both the Quality of Well-being Scale-self administered version and the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, patients with epilepsy had statistically lower values than did the control group (P < 0.0001). In terms of the WTP/month, the percentage of WTP accounting for the monthly income and the WTP/QALY values from the epilepsy group were substantially higher than those from the control group (P < 0.0001). WTP/QALY=12×WTPMonth1−Utility(CurrentHealth) The multiple linear regression model identified working status (P = 0.05), seizure types (P = 0.022), income (P = 0.006), and self-rating health state (P < 0.05) as predictors of HRQOL while income (P = 0.000) and self-rating health state (P < 0.05) statistically contributed to the variations in WTP/QALY value for the epilepsy group.
Conclusions
Patients with epilepsy had substantially lower HRQOL than did the healthy population.}

abstract = {Objective
This study was undertaken to examine the dose-response relationship of zafirlukast (5 to 40 mg BID) and to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the 10-mg BID dose in school-aged children with mild to moderate asthma.
Background
The efficacy and tolerability of zafirlukast, an oral leukotriene-receptor antagonist, has been demonstrated in adolescents and adults aged ≥12 years.
Methods
Data from 2 placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials (trial 1, 4-week double-blind; trial 2, 6-week double-blind) were integrated. Children aged 5 to 11 years were randomly assigned to receive zafirlukast 5 mg BID (n = 99), 10 mg BID (n = 205), 20 mg BID (n = 105), 40 mg BID (n = 99), or placebo (n = 206). The primary outcome was change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) expressed as percent of predicted normal. Secondary outcomes were FEV1 (L), morning and evening peak expiratory flow, peak flow variability, short-acting beta2-agonist use, asthma episode score, and nights awakened by asthma.
Results
Mean baseline FEV1 was 76.5% of predicted. The greatest improvements were generally seen with zafirlukast 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID, with no additional clinically significant benefits seen at higher doses. The pooled data analysis showed that 10 mg BID compared with placebo significantly improved (P < 0.045) all efficacy outcomes except asthma-episode score and nights awakened with asthma. However, in the subset of children who had ≥1 night awakened per week at baseline (zafirlukast 10 mg BID = 78; placebo = 86), 10 mg BID significantly reduced nights awakened (P = 0.009) (mean difference from placebo at end point = −0.81 night/wk). All zafirlukast doses were well tolerated and had tolerability profiles that were clinically indistinguishable from placebo.
Conclusion
These results support the effectiveness and tolerability of the 10-mg BID dose of zafirlukast for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma in children.}

It also takes into account the importance of eminence and previous works as the most important non-monetary evaluation criterion used by owners for evaluating bids. These factors combined with the two decisions make this model complex and nonlinear. To solve this model, a customized Genetic Algorithm is developed. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the result of the model is compared to the results of conventional models that only consider bidding markups. The comparison shows that considering eminence can increase the expected profit of the contractor to more than 25% under some evaluation criteria mindsets of the owner.}

The empirical results show that funding liquidity affects market liquidity, and that the impact of illiquidity contagion between SPYs and E-minis was significant during the subprime mortgage crisis. In particular, the contagion effects between the two markets mediate the impact of funding illiquidity on market liquidity during the credit crunch. Considering the influences of other market factors on price discovery, we suggest that E-mini index futures made less contributions to price discovery during the credit crunch compared to normal periods.

These results imply that institutional investors are better informed about IPO value, and that they obtain higher information rents when they bid higher relative to retail investors.

Our application values reductions in nutrient loads to lakes in the southeastern US. The innovation centers on how biochemical measures of water quality (e.g., chlorophyll a) are translated into terms that are meaningful to individuals who derive ecosystem services from them. Using expert elicitation data, we estimate a model linking changes in biochemical measures to an index of eutrophication in lakes. We then develop a stated preference survey including (a) detailed descriptions of the perceptible outcomes – e.g., water color, clarity – associated each eutrophication index level; and (b) policy scenarios involving state-level changes in lake eutrophication conditions. We estimate a function that predicts households' willingness to pay for changes in lake water quality. We demonstrate the protocol through a case study examining the benefits of lake quality improvement in Virginia as a result of recent policies to reduce nutrient loads in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.}

This paper describes a new day-ahead optimization model between energy and secondary reserve bids and an operational management algorithm that coordinates EV charging in order to minimize differences between contracted and realized values. The use of forecasts for EV and market prices is included, as well as a market settlement scheme that includes a penalty term for reserve shortage.

We specifically leverage bandwidth calendaring, a technique that allows shifting bulk data transfers, typically of large size with less stringent real-time constraints, to future epochs when the network is less congested. In particular, we propose an auction-based framework for bandwidth calendaring, where the C-RAN operator, as the spectrum auctioneer, runs an auction with its users, with the aim of maximizing its revenue. The auction-based mechanism takes as input the set of the users’ bids and outputs the calendaring and pricing decisions. We first formulate the calendaring problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and the pricing problem using the Vickrey Clarke Groves (VCG) pricing scheme. We further make use of the Bayesian settings to compute the optimal revenue. Due to the exponential time induced by the NP-hardness of the ILP formulation, we propose an effective approach that satisfies desired auction properties such as individual rationality and truthfulness while achieving a sub-optimal revenue, in polynomial time. We explicitly evaluate the impact of mobile systems features such as spatial frequency re-use and interference among mobile users, and study their impact on the overall system’s performance. Extensive simulations, conducted in representative network scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal in improving the performance of C-RAN scheduling.}

abstract = {Physical dependence or withdrawal is an expected effect of prolonged opioid therapy. Oxytrex (oxycodone + ultralow-dose naltrexone) is an investigational drug shown here to minimize physical dependence while providing strong analgesia with twice-daily dosing. In this 719-patient, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled Phase III clinical trial in chronic low back pain, patients were randomized to receive placebo, oxycodone qid, or oxytrex qid or bid. Each oxytrex tablet contains 1 μg naltrexone; oxytrex bid and qid treatments provide 2 and 4 μg naltrexone/day, respectively. Following a washout, patients with pain ≥5 on a 0-10 scale were dose-escalated weekly from 10 up to 80 mg/day until reaching adequate pain relief (≤2) or a tolerable level of side effects. Following titration, the dose was fixed for 12 weeks. Active treatment groups attained comparable analgesia despite significantly lower drug use (P = .03) by oxytrex patients. Patients taking oxytrex bid reported 55% less physical dependence than patients on oxycodone (P = .01) by the Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale 24 h after treatment cessation. Oxytrex bid patients also reported decreased moderate-to-severe constipation (by 44%, P = .01), somnolence (by 33%, P = .03), and pruritus (by 51%, P < .001). This is the first large well controlled study to show strong analgesia with minimal withdrawal symptoms and better safety compared with oxycodone.
Perspective
Previous clinical data have shown ultralow-dose naltrexone enhances and prolongs oxycodone analgesia, and preclinical data also show a suppression of opioid tolerance and dependence.

abstract = {Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is observed in many human diseases, often associated with inflammation. ER stress can trigger inflammation through nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLRP3) inflammasome, which might stimulate inflammasome formation by association with damaged mitochondria. How ER stress triggers mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammasome activation is ill defined. Here we have used an infection model to show that the IRE1α ER stress sensor regulates regulated mitochondrial dysfunction through an NLRP3-mediated feed-forward loop, independently of ASC. IRE1α activation increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, promoting NLRP3 association with mitochondria. NLRP3 was required for ER stress-induced cleavage of caspase-2 and the pro-apoptotic factor, Bid, leading to subsequent release of mitochondrial contents. Caspase-2 and Bid were necessary for activation of the canonical inflammasome by infection-associated or general ER stress. These data identify an NLRP3-caspase-2-dependent mechanism that relays ER stress to the mitochondria to promote inflammation, integrating cellular stress and innate immunity.}

abstract = {Background
A prolonged-release formulation of tacrolimus for once-daily administration (tacrolimus QD) has been developed. This phase II, open-label, multicenter, prospective single-arm study compared the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tacrolimus in stable heart transplant patients before and after conversion from twice-daily tacrolimus (tacrolimus BID) to tacrolimus QD.
Methods
Heart transplant recipients (≥6 months after transplant), previously maintained on tacrolimus BID–based therapy, received tacrolimus BID from Days 1 to 7 and were converted on a 1:1 (mg/mg) basis to tacrolimus QD. Five 24-hour PK profiles were collected (Days 1, 7, 8, 14, 21). Safety parameters were also evaluated.
Results
Of 85 patients, 45 (50.6%) completed all 5 evaluable PK profiles. Steady-state tacrolimus area under the curve, 0 to 24 hours (AUC0–24) and minimum concentration (Cmin) were comparable for both formulations, with treatment ratio means of 90.5% (90% confidence intervals [CI], 86.4%–94.6%) and 87.4% (95% CI, 82.9%–92.0%), respectively (acceptance interval, 80%–125%). There was good correlation between AUC0–24 and Cmin for tacrolimus QD (r = 0.94) and BID (r = 0.91). The relationship between these 2 parameters was also similar.
Conclusions
This study provides evidence for successful conversion from tacrolimus BID to QD on a 1:1 (mg/mg) total daily dose basis. Approximately one-third of patients may require dose adjustments. Both formulations were well tolerated, with stable renal function during the study. Adverse events were reported by approximately one-tenth of patients receiving tacrolimus BID and a quarter of those who received QD.}

It bears a unique, intrinsically unstructured, N-terminal sequence, which leads to its instability in cells and hinders protein production and structural characterization. Here, we present collective data from NMR spectroscopy and titration calorimetry to reveal the selectivity of MCL-1 in binding BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) ligands of interest for mammalian biology. The N-terminal sequence weakens the BH3 interactions but does not affect selectivity. Its removal by calpain-mediated limited proteolysis results in a stable BCL-2-like core domain of MCL-1 (cMCL-1). This core is necessary and sufficient for BH3 ligand binding. Significantly, we also characterized the in vitro protein-protein interaction between cMCL-1 and activated BID by size exclusion chromatography and NMR titrations. This interaction occurs in a very slow manner in solution but is otherwise similar to the interaction between cMCL-1 and BID-BH3 peptides. We also present the solution structure of complex cMCL-1·hBID-BH3, which completes the family portrait of MCL-1 complexes and may facilitate drug discovery against human tumors.}

As auctions, they are novel in that they feature publicly “recommended” but non-binding bid prices and bidders with identical budget constraints. Recommended prices prove to be reasonable forecasts of player value and bidding on average tends to follow those recommendations. Individual bidding behavior, however, follows a distinct pattern of overbidding followed by underbidding (relative to recommended value). Participants tend to overbid early, paying more than the recommended value for the first two or three players they win, irrespective of who those players are. Underbidding for the next few picks then follows, with some overbidding occurring for the last pick. This behavior suggests a new variety of declining price phenomenon which we believe is reflective of the auction environment.}

Better stock price performance for PTS transactions comes mainly from targets with high Tobin's Q.

Firms with accounting-based deficiencies exhibit income-increasing discretionary accruals. In contrast, firms with market-based deficiencies do not. We also find that shareholders' equity-deficient firms respond with equity issuances and bid price-deficient firms initiate reverse stock splits. These findings suggest that firms trade off among methods to meet benchmarks based on costs and constraints.

This research uses an event study method and finds that the air quality in Hangzhou was significantly improved during the G20 period and, most importantly, this positive impact seems to be a long-term phenomenon, contrary to previous studies. A placebo analysis on a similar city does not find comparable patterns, offering empirical support for a causal explanation. This paper further analyzes the steps that Hangzhou took in preparation for the G20 summit and finds many long-term oriented measures such as technological upgrades and transition from fossil fuels to clean energies.

The prognosis of heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in Japan remains poor, although there is growing evidence for increasing use of evidence-based pharmacotherapies in Japanese real-world HF registries. Sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) is a first-in-class angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in the recently completed largest outcome trial in patients with HFrEF (PARADIGM-HF trial). The prospectively designed phase III PARALLEL-HF (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ACE inhibitor to determine the noveL beneficiaL trEatment vaLue in Japanese Heart Failure patients) study aims to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of LCZ696 in Japanese HFrEF patients, and show similar improvements in clinical outcomes as the PARADIGM-HF study enabling the registration of LCZ696 in Japan.
Methods and design
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active controlled study of 220 Japanese HFrEF patients. Eligibility criteria include a diagnosis of chronic HF (New York Heart Association Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%) and increased plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides [N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) ≥600pg/mL, or NT-proBNP ≥400pg/mL for those who had a hospitalization for HF within the last 12 months] at the screening visit. The study consists of three phases: (i) screening, (ii) single-blind active LCZ696 run-in, and (iii) double-blind randomized treatment. Patients tolerating LCZ696 50mg bid during the treatment run-in are randomized (1:1) to receive LCZ696 100mg bid or enalapril 5mg bid for 4 weeks followed by up-titration to target doses of LCZ696 200mg bid or enalapril 10mg bid in a double-blind manner. The primary outcome is the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and the study is an event-driven trial.
Conclusions
The design of the PARALLEL-HF study is aligned with the PARADIGM-HF study and aims to assess the efficacy and safety of LCZ696 in Japanese HFrEF patients.}

abstract = {Purpose
LCB01-0371 is a novel oxazolidinone broad-spectrum antibacterial that is more potent than linezolid against systemic infections in animals. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of multiple-dose LCB01-0371 as well as the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a new 400-mg tablet formulation.
Methods
: Thirty-two healthy male subjects received BID 400–1600 mg multiple oral dosing of LCB01-0371 (200-mg tablet or 400-mg tablet) for 7 days, and 6 subjects received an 800-mg single oral dose of LCB01-0371 (400-mg tablet). Safety assessments were undertaken at regular intervals. Blood and urine were sampled, and drug concentration and inhibitory and bactericidal titers were measured.
Findings
LCB01-0371 was generally safe and well tolerated up to 1200 mg BID for 7 days. Adverse events were mild, except for headache, nausea, and dizziness at the dose of 1600 mg, and resolved spontaneously. LCB01-0371 was absorbed rapidly within 2 h after administration, and its accumulation observed on day 7 ranged between 1.10- and 1.46-fold. The elimination t1/2 was 1.64–1.94 h, which remained unchanged across all doses. AUC0–12 and Cmax were not dose proportional across the dose range from 400 to 1200 mg after both single and multiple dosing, indicating a nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile. The percentage of the dose excreted via the urine ranged from 7.84% to 8.95%. The new (400-mg tablet) formulation exhibited less interindividual variability with pharmacokinetic characteristics similar to the original formulation (200-mg tablet). LCB01-0371 exhibited both early serum inhibitory and bactericidal activities against the 4 strains tested in the ex vivo pharmacodynamics study.
Implications
BID doses of LCB01-0371 up to 1200 mg for 7 days were well tolerated and exhibited rapid serum inhibitory and bactericidal activities against common gram-positive pathogens. The results warrant further clinical investigation of the antibacterial effect of BID LCB01-0371 administration. ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01842516.}

abstract = {Internet auctions bring buyers and sellers together for the purpose of trading goods and services online. In order to get the goods, a buyer must search for items through several auction sites. When the auction starts, the buyer needs to connect to these auction sites frequently so that he/she can monitor the bid states and re-bid. In this paper, we propose an automated negotiation model between two participants, for mobile commerce, using collaborative mobile agents called MoRVAM, which mediates between the buyer and the sellers, and executes bidding asynchronously and autonomously. A new RVT protocol is also implemented to achieve unconditional bid privacy. Advantages of the RVT protocol are addressed as well. All the bidding process can be implemented without revealing losing bid and unnecessary information.}

Especially, combining the strengths of humans and machines helps tackle increasing hard tasks that neither can be done alone. Following this trend, this paper designs a Quality aware Truthful Incentive mechanism for cyber–physical enabled Geographic crowdsensing called Geo-QTI. Different from existing work, Geo-QTI appropriately accommodates the utilities of various stakeholders: requesters, participants and the crowdsourcing platform, and explicitly takes the requesters’ quality requirements, and participants’ quality provision into account. Geo-QTI explicitly includes four components: requester selection, participant selection, pricing and allocation. Requester selection with feasible analysis removes the requesters whose job cannot be completed by all participants or suffers from the monopoly participant (without the participant’s contribution, others cannot cover requesters’ requirement), obtains winning requesters set and determines actual payments. In participant selection phase, the platform aggregates the requested tasks (submitted by all winning requesters) in the sensed geographic area, and chooses the appropriate participants satisfying the winning requesters’ quality requirements with total cost as low as possible. Pricing phase determines the payments to winning participants. The phase of allocation assigns the specific participants to minimally cover the quality requirements of those winning requesters. Rigid theoretical analysis demonstrates Geo-QTI can achieve both requesters’ and participants’ individual rationality and truthfulness, computational efficiency and budget balance for the platform. Furthermore, the extensive simulations confirm our theoretical analysis, and illustrate that Geo-QTI can reduce requesters’ expenses greatly and ensure the fairness of allocation.}

An empirical application dealing with WTP estimation for drinking water quality improvements illustrates a case where a flexible modeling approach based on Copula distributions allows relevant gains with respect to the Single Bound estimator.}

This paper theoretically assesses whether the pipeline serves as an effective tool to levy this barrier to entry. A theoretical model and a simulation experiment that mimics the tendering process with heterogeneity in the bidders' cost structure are presented. In particular, the impact on the ex ante bid preparation effort willingness and the mark-ups is assessed by heuristically approximating the Bayesian Nash equilibrium. A statistical scenario analysis approves that mark-ups are lower when more projects are included in the pipeline, leading to fiercer price competition and a lower government procurement cost. Nonetheless, the incentive creation with respect to investment efforts is limited according to the experiment.}

In the Bitcoin system, miners provide computing power to confirm transactions and mine blocks in pursuit of transaction fees, while users compete by bidding transaction fees for faster confirmation. This process is in essence analogous to online ad auctions, where advertisers bid for more prominent ad slots. Therefore, inspired by the Generalized Second Price (GSP) mechanism dominantly used in online ad auctions, we propose to adopt the GSP auction model in the Bitcoin transaction confirmation game. Also, we use weighted fees as the new ranking basis, which can be calculated by user-submitted fees, transaction size, quality scores and virtual fees accumulated from the waiting time. We show that the formulated static GSP transaction fee auction with complete information has a unique Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium. Then, we discuss the impacts of quality scores and virtual fees on users' equilibrium fee decisions and payoffs. Finally, computational experiments are designed to validate our theoretical models and analysis. Our research findings indicate that this novel GSP mechanism is superior to the currently adopted GFP mechanism, and can help users save fees. Besides, quality scores and virtual fees are also proven to be effective on reducing users' paid fees. Moreover, the design of virtual fees allows all transactions to be processed more efficiently in a uniform pipeline, and the interests of transactions with and without associated fees are taken into consideration.}

Background
Long-acting bronchodilators are first-line treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and their efficacy on lung function and clinical parameters is recognized.
Objective
To explore the available evidence about the effects of long acting bronchodilators on Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Health Status (HS) in clinical research.
Methods
Randomized controlled trials published till December 2012 evaluating HRQoL/HS in COPD by means of validated questionnaires were analysed.
Results
Fifty-one trials on Long acting β2 agonist (LABA) and Long acting Anticholinergic (LAMA) met the inclusion criteria. A total of 37,225 moderate-severe COPD patients testing 6 drugs, 12 different devices and 22 different dosages, with a study duration ranging from 4 weeks to 4 years were studied. A statistical significant HRQoL/HS improvement was reached in 93% of the studies. Nevertheless, the Minimal Important Difference (MID) was reached in 70,6% of the studies considering the difference between baseline and end of the study, and in 50% when comparing active treatment and placebo.
Conclusions
The data coming from the review support the efficacy of long acting bronchodilators in improving HRQoL/HS of COPD patients. Further research evaluating HRQoL/HS as primary outcome and according to guidelines on Patient Reported Outcomes is needed.}

This reduction is greater for high impact news and on days with high volatility. In addition, we assess the effect of algorithmic trading on market quality around macroeconomic news. In the minute following a macroeconomic news arrival, algorithmic activity increases trading volume and depth at the best quotes, but also increases volatility and leads to a drop in overall depth. Quoted half-spreads decrease (increase) when we measure algorithmic trading over the full (top of the) order book.}

abstract = {Background
Vulnerabilities in social motivation among children with ASD constrain attention and responsiveness to parents and other social partners. When this limited social responsiveness remains uncorrected, it is hypothesized to restrict the quality and quantity of social learning opportunities and ultimately yield negative long-term effects on development. Early intervention efforts that target social motivation may hold promise for correcting this detrimental chain of events.
Method
The current pilot RCT examined changes in participant social responsiveness and language use in a trial of 21 young children with ASD who were randomly assigned to treatment or waitlist control groups. Treatment participants received a mean of 6.81 h/week of an enhanced Pivotal Response Intervention for Social Motivation (PRISM) treatment model for six months. Data on social responsiveness to parent bids and expressive language (number of total words, number of different words, mean length of utterance in words) were obtained from behaviorally coding and analyzing video-recorded parent-child play sessions.
Results
Results indicated that young children who participated in the PRISM treatment model demonstrated significant pre-post improvements in social responsiveness and mean length of utterances. Participants in the waitlist condition experienced negligible improvements. Participants who are minimally verbal appear to experience greater gains as a result of the PRISM model. Additionally, initial levels of social responsiveness with parents appear to be predictive of subsequent language use at post-intervention among minimally verbal participants.
Conclusion
This study provides preliminary evidence for the importance of using early intervention paradigms that explicitly target social motivation and responsiveness in young children with ASD. Results also suggest that initial social responsiveness to parents may serve as an important predictor of treatment response.}

Estimation results based on a survey data of 1000 households show that most explanatory variables including bid amounts and household income significantly influenced dichotomous choice contingent valuation responses with expected signs. When applied to the whole sample, mean willingness to pay reflecting both use and non-use values was stable at around $3.70 per year for the improvement of air quality information. Present values of total benefits over the lifetime period of the space satellite exceed the cost born by tax payers with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.77. The result of this study clearly suggests that contingent valuation method can be used as an alternative approach in measuring the value of information from a space-derived earth science project.}

First, we identified differences between men and women in the utilities of the contract and relative risk aversion as potential drivers of the decrease in bids by women compared to men in the auction for action-based contracts. Second, we observed a gender-specific difference in perceptions of risk in the outcome-based approach when women increased their bids. Third, women achieved lower tree survival than men, despite women providing more effort. In this context, we identified the inequality in reciprocal labor for male and female contract holders as a possible source of the gendered tree survival. This case study showed that targeting women improves gender equity in terms of access to project decision-making, trainings and cash, and can significantly improve the effectiveness of the PES scheme.}

This method was shown to work with five different honey varieties which had a range of water from 14–16%. It also utilised two different detectors, the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and the barrier discharge ionisation detector (BID). This method needs no heating pretreatment step as in the current leading method, (i.e. the measurement of refractive index). The solvent-free procedure negates the possibility of solvent–compound interactions as well as solubility limitations, as is common with Karl Fischer titrations. It was also apparent that the classic loss on drying method consistently and substantially produced results that were lower than the correct values. This approach is shown to be rapid, with an analysis time of 4min when using the TCD detector and under 3min when utilising the BID detector. HSGC is feasible for the determination of water due to the new PEG-linked geminal dicationic ionic-liquid-coated GC capillary column. In addition it provides accurate and precise determinations of the water content in honey. When using the sensitive BID detector, other trace volatile compounds are observed as well.}

However, the traditional random utility maximization (RUM) models underlying the choice experiment approach ignores the important influence of anticipated regret on individual choice behaviour. To explore the importance of regret in public preferences for air quality improvement policies, this study introduces random regret minimization (RRM) models in the analysing of public choices, and further compares the performance of utility-based and regret-based discrete choice modelling based on the multinomial logit and hybrid latent class models. The results suggest that the RRM models outperform the RUM model regarding goodness of fit and prediction, indicating that the RRM models can be used as an alternative and supplement to traditional RUM models. Particularly, 55.9% of the choices from respondents are mainly driven by regret. Our results also reveal that respondents driven by regret-based choice paradigm have a stronger preference for increased clean air days, reduced haze days and lower mortality, whereas utility-based respondents prefer to shorten the years of policy delay. These findings are useful for the design of socially optimal policies on the sustainable management of air pollution and providing theoretical reference for the development of environment-related policies.}

While the auction mechanism has been the subject of a number of studies, less attention has been paid to the post-bidding contract phase. As contracts involving natural resource management are usually incomplete, trust becomes crucial for the effectiveness of the programme. We test the effect of communication between auctioneer and bidders on bidding behaviour and contract fulfilment using experimental economics. We combine a repeated reverse auction with an effort-level game and use a bilateral chatting tool as treatment variable. Without communication, auctioneers tended to select the lowest-priced bidders, who invested substantially less than the socially optimal level of effort when fulfilling their contract to provide the public good. Relational contracting proved important, with effort levels and profits tending to be higher when auctioneers and bidders entered into consecutive contract relationships. In the communication treatment there was no evidence of price competition, as auctioneers were more likely to accept high-priced bids. However, an overall higher price level did not lead to efficiency losses, since contractors realised higher effort levels in return, establishing a ‘social gift exchange’. Our results demonstrate the importance of trust-based relationships between the auctioneering institution and landholders.}

abstract = {Under the implicit assumption of well-developed capital markets and strong investor protection, finance theory predicts that managers of target firms will respond to a takeover threat by increasing firm leverage. Leverage increases target management’s negotiating position with the bidder, potentially thwarting the acquisition altogether. Target management should therefore have less incentive to increase leverage where investor protections are weak and financial regulations favor incumbents. Examining changes in firm leverage in an international sample of target firms, we find that targets significantly increase leverage around takeover attempts, but only in countries with well-developed capital markets and strong investor protections. These target firms realize negative abnormal returns around debt issuance announcements, especially those between takeover announcement and withdrawal. Further, target shareholders suffer significantly negative long-term returns after the takeover bid is withdrawn. Negative returns are significantly mitigated, but not eliminated, with high performance target managers in place.}

abstract = {This article studies a model of asymmetric risk averse bidding within the independent private value paradigm. The inherent asymmetry in cost and risk aversion imposes an original restriction on the observed bid data, an exact equality which leads to the model semiparametric identification and estimation. The unobserved arguments of this equality need to be simulated in order to estimate the bidders’ Constant Relative Risk Aversion or Constant Absolute Risk Aversion parameters and their heterogeneous cost distributions. In the Los Angeles City Hall construction contracts offered between 1994 and 2003, the model and methodology help reveal that financial asymmetries affect the firms’ cost distribution, while experience influences their degree of risk aversion.}

abstract = {In theoretical models of limit order books populated with liquidity traders there is a link between order aggressiveness, spreads, and the cost of waiting for execution. We directly test these models using an experimental setting where waiting time is important for traders, namely the ex-dividend day. Consistent with these models, we find that order placement is more aggressive before stocks begin trading ex-dividend. Stocks with higher expected costs of delaying execution experience larger declines in order aggressiveness from the cum-day to the ex-day. Waiting costs also impact effective bid-ask spreads, which fall on the cum-day before rising on the ex-day.}

These tests are applied to a unique data set containing winning bids and measures of the value and dispersion of information signals in eBay auctions for computers. Results suggest that prices partially aggregate information but do not converge to the common value. Even away from the limit, more bidders and stronger information have a significant effect on the convergence of prices and information aggregation. Even partial information aggregation may represent a potential efficiency gain over one-to-one trade of used goods with uncertain common values.}

On one hand, prior research indicates that short sellers may act, at times, as liquidity providers. On the other hand, other research in market microstructure argues that spreads will widen in the presence of informed traders – a classification generally given to short sellers. Results from a series of new, multivariate time-series tests show that exogenous shocks to short selling activity generally lead to a widening of bid-ask spreads in smaller-cap stocks. The results, however, do not hold for larger-cap stocks.}

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has been an emerging technology thanks to the smart devices which are capable of sensing and computing to achieve large-scale, complex sensing tasks by cooperation. However, large-scale deployment might be impeded due to that fact that the participant may face the risk of privacy leakage, and if they are not compensated favorably, they may not be willing to contribute sensing capability. To overcome the above challenges, we propose an incentive mechanism for privacy-preserving mobile crowdsensing. More specifically, we introduce a trusted third party and combine partially blind signature, which can effectively reduce the correlation between participants and data and the number of interactions between users and task platform, so as to achieve high level participant privacy. In addition, considering data quality, we define some concepts including data quality relevance, user credit, location relevance and user utility, and design a Credit-based Incentive Mechanism (CIM) based on marginal benefit density and credit, in order to obtain the maximum benefit of a task platform under given budget. Extensive simulations are carried out to show that the proposed incentive mechanism achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art solutions. To the existing multi-stage incentive solutions, our proposed solution can achieve higher-quality data at the expense of less time efficiency.}

abstract = {We estimate the effect of lake water quality on residential housing prices using cross-sectional data on water clarity from 113 lakes across the United States. An instrumental-variables approach is developed to address potential endogeneity bias in the water-clarity variable. Three lake-based physical variables serve as instrumental variables: total nitrogen concentration in lake water, total phosphorus concentration in lake water, and water temperature near the lake surface. The econometric results include three methodological findings: the instruments are valid and strong; the ordinary-least-squares estimate of the coefficient on the water-clarity variable is unbiased; and water clarity is the attribute of water quality valued in the housing market. The estimated water-clarity effect shows that a one-tenth of a meter change in water clarity leads to a one-percent change in housing price, or an elasticity of 0.20 at mean clarity. Coupling this effect with estimates of an ecological production function, a lake-specific benefit index is developed that shows the effect on housing values of bringing lakes into compliance with the US Environmental Protection Agency's regional recommendations for phosphorous concentration in lake waters.}

Semantic web services (SWS) technology aims to add sufficient semantics to the specifications and implementations of web services to make possible the (automatic) integration of distributed autonomous systems, with independently designed data and behaviour models. Defining data, behaviour and system components in a machine understandable way using ontologies provides the basis for reducing the need for humans to be in the loop for routine system integration processes. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a unique bid auction application for procurement automation within supply chains embedded in extended and virtual enterprises. We show how emerging semantic web services technologies such as the web services execution environment (WSMX) facilitate the creation of such applications, and we discuss the advantages of such applications.}

Using data on Chinese cross-listing AH-shares over the period of 2010–2015, we find that short sale restricts accrual earnings management in A-share markets but not in the H-share market. This difference is explained by the relative inferiority of the A-share markets’ regulatory quality, and is accentuated when the cross-listing AH-share firms have weak internal control. Taken together, the results indicate that short-sellers impose strong monitoring on reporting quality when they perceive a great likelihood of managerial expropriation in a weak legal environment, or in firms with weak internal control.}
