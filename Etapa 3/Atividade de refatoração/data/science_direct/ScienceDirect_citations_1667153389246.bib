abstract = {Objective:
The efficacy of ciclesonide 160 μg QD (given either in the morning or evening) was compared with budesonide 200 μg BID in adults with stable asthma that was pretreated with inhaled corticosteroids.
Methods:
This was a randomized, 3-arm, parallel-groupstudy comparing ciclesonide (given in a double-blind, double-dummy regimen) with open-label budesonide. After 2 to 2.5 weeks, during which patients were treated with budesonide 200 μg BID, patients (n = 405) were randomly assigned to receive ciclesonide 160 μg QD AM or 160 μg QD pm, or budesonide 200 μg BID (all administered by metered-dose inhaler) for 12 weeks. All patients received 2 puffs of medication (or placebo) in the morning and evening. The primary efficacy variable was the difference in spirometric forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 in liters) from randomization to study end. Secondary efficacy end points were forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow by spirometry, and diary assessments of peak expiratory flow, asthma symptoms, and rescue medication use. Adverse events were assessed by patient report, investigator observation, physical examination, and laboratory testing; events were classified as mild, moderate, or severe.
Results:
Baseline demographic characteristics with regard to sex, age, weight, smoking status, baseline medication use, and FEV1 were balanced among the treatment groups. Over the course of treatment, both ciclesonide and budesonide maintained FEV1 compared with baseline. Both ciclesonide regimens were as effective as budesonide 200 μg BID in maintaining FEV1 during the treatment period versus baseline (ciclesonide 160 μg QD am: 95% CI, −0.120 to 0.045 vs budesonide; P = NS; ciclesonide 160 μg QD pm: 95% CI, −0.061 to 0.105 vs budesonide; P = NS). Ciclesonide 160 μg QD (morning or evening) was comparable with budesonide 200 μg BID for maintaining pulmonary function, asthma symptom scores, and rescue medication use. The incidence of adverse events was not significantly different among the treatment groups, and most adverse events were not related to study medication.
Conclusions:
In this study, ciclesonide 160 μg QDwas as effective as budesonide 200 μg BID (400 μg total daily dose) in these adults with persistent asthma. Both treatments were well tolerated.}

When talking about electricity markets one usually refers to active power markets paying less attention to ancillary services, namely to reactive power/voltage control. This usually leads to a chronological sequence of activities that may lead to inefficiencies because active and reactive powers are coupled given the capability diagram of synchronous generators, the ac power flow equations and the branch thermal limits. In this paper, we propose new models to remarry active and reactive allocation procedures based on a market approach as a way to ensure operation transparency. The resulting optimization problems are solved by a Sequential Linear Programming, SLP, approach that allows one to compute active and reactive nodal marginal prices at its final iteration. The paper includes a case study based on the IEEE 24 Bus Test System to illustrate the application of the developed models and demonstrate their interest in the scope of restructured power systems.}

Conventional wisdom suggests that advertisers can only benefit from improving their advertisement's quality. With an empirical study, this article shows that quality improvements have complex effects whose returns are actually unclear: 5% of all quality improvements to an advertisement lead to higher prices (measured by price per click) per keyword, 100% to a higher number of clicks, 53% to higher costs for search engine marketing, and 37% to lower profits. Quality improvements lead to higher weighted bids, which only lower prices if they do not improve the ranking of the advertisement. Otherwise, better ranks likely lead to higher prices. A decomposition method can disentangle these effects and explain their effects on search engine marketing costs and profits. Finally, the results indicate that advertisers benefit if they lower their bids after improvements to advertising quality.}

We further report a negative and significant relation between bidder gains and free cash flow. This relation is particularly strong for firms classified as having poor investment opportunities.

abstract = {Background
Ivabradine, a selective inhibitor of the pacemaker current in the sinoatrial node, has shown pure heart rate (HR)-reducing effects with anti-ischemic efficacy as well as improvement in heart failure outcomes.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to explore pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics and tolerability in healthy male Korean volunteers, as well as to compare them with PK/PD profiles of white subjects.
Methods
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I study conducted in healthy male subjects. For each of the 3 dosing groups, 9 subjects were randomized to receive ivabradine and 3 to receive placebo. Subjects received a single oral dose of ivabradine 2.5, 5, or 10 mg and after a 3-day washout period, repeat doses of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg BID for 4.5 days. Blood and urine samples were collected over 72 hours during each period, and levels of ivabradine and its metabolite S18982 were determined by using validated LC-MS/MS, followed by noncompartmental PK analysis. For PD properties and tolerability, 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained: at baseline, after a single dose, after repeated doses, and after the last dose. Serial resting 12-lead ECG assessments were also performed throughout the study.
Results
Forty-eight subjects were enrolled, and 45 completed the study. After single doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg, respective mean Cmax levels of ivabradine were 9, 15, and 39 ng/mL, and mean AUC0–last values were 30, 52, and 121 ng h/mL. At steady state, mean Cmax,ss levels were 11, 19, and 42 ng/mL, reached at a median Tmax of 0.67 hour for all 3 doses. The mean AUC0–τ levels were 43, 58, and 139 ng h/mL, respectively. The PK findings were linear with dose and time. Decreases in mean HR on both the Holter recordings and ECGs were observed in all of the ivabradine groups compared with placebo. After the repeated doses, mean decreases in HR were greater than those for the single doses for the same period. Statistically significant differences were observed between the 5- and 10-mg ivabradine groups and placebo. A total of 3 adverse events were reported in 2 subjects receiving ivabradine; both fully recovered without sequelae.
Conclusions
Single and repeated administration of ivabradine were generally well tolerated in these healthy male Korean volunteers. Ivabradine induced significant reductions in HR, especially at doses of 5 and 10 mg. PK/PD characteristics were similar to those found in white subjects, suggesting that the dose concentration–response relationship of ivabradine is similar between Korean and white subjects.}

The cross-sectional relationship between rounding and trading variables is similar before and after the decimalization, and so is the relationship between execution costs and rounding when trading variables are held constant. More importantly, the quoted and effective bid–ask spreads decrease after decimal trading, and this decrease can be ascribed to the decrease in rounding frequency after controlling for the changes in trading variables.}

In particular, we consider a procurement auction in which the buyer is the auctioneer and the sellers are the bidders. Such domains include auctions on task allocation, services, etc. We focus on three auction protocols for the case of multi-attribute items; a variation of the first-price sealed-bid protocol termed first-score sealed-bid, a variation of the second-price sealed-bid protocol termed second-score sealed-bid, and a variation of the English auction protocol termed sequential full information revelation. We analyze a specific model for these protocols and we provide optimal and stable strategies for the auctioneer agent and for the bidder agents participating in multi-attribute auctions. In addition, we analyze the auctioneer's/buyer's expected payoff and suggest an optimal scoring rule to be announced according to the protocol. Finally, we reveal that the buyer's expected payoff in all three protocols, the first-score-sealed-bid auction, the second-score sealed-bid auction and the English auction, differ only by a predefined constant. We prove that the optimal scoring rule is equal in all three protocols. This result can be interpreted as the extension of the equivalence theory of the single attribute for the case of multi-attribute items.}

Managers that undertake mergers during bullish periods are rewarded by the generalized upward trend of the market in the short-run. However, this is followed by long-term reversals as the market learns only gradually that many of the mergers undertaken during hot periods were not carefully evaluated and were made under the pressure of ‘urge to merge’ to take advantage of the overall market status of a particular period.}

On the other hand, smart water networks and sophisticated Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems in the water industry have allowed one to optimize, control and monitor the water flow throughout its entire process. Being a highly energy intensive industry and having an electrical flexibility by the presence of storage elements such as tanks, drinking water systems have the ability to address energy efficiency mechanisms such as Demand Response. In this paper, the French demand response mechanism in spot power markets is presented. Then, a chance constrained problem is formulated to integrate water systems flexibility to power system operation, under water demand uncertainties. Numerical results are discussed based on a real water system in France, demonstrating the relevance of the approach in terms of financial benefits and risk management.}

In this study, how bid prices for parrotfishes (Scaridae spp.) determined at auction were investigated in a tropical island, southern Japan (Yaeyama fish market, Okinawa) between April 2011 and March 2015. Six factors, i.e. month, supply, size of fish, fishing gear type, bruising on the body, and endo-parasitic infection were chosen as variables, and their effects on bid prices were investigated using a generalized linear model with a log-normal error distribution in six selected species (Chlorurus microrhinos, Hipposcarus longiceps, Scarus ghobban, S. rivulatus, S. rubroviolaceus, Bolbometopon muricatum). All variables significantly affected the prices. The effects of supply were thought to remain for up to seven days from the AIC (Akaike’s Information Criterion) comparison, and the supply affected prices more than month did. For all species, the prices increased with fish size for smaller size ranges, but inversely decreased for larger size ranges. Prices of medium sized species took the highest values at 1.0–2.0 kg in size. Scarid fishes were mainly caught by spearfishing at night, but spear bruising on the body, parasitic infection, and being caught by gillnet significantly reduced prices (ca. minus 200–300 yen/kg for each case). Results obtained here are useful to increase the catch of higher quality fish by regulation (size, season, site etc.), to help reduce risk of price collapse triggered by large catch (oversupply), and to enable discussion of appropriate fisheries management practices.}

This glycosphingolipid is a B cell differentiation antigen (Gb3/CD77) strongly expressed on Burkitt's lymphoma cells. We have previously shown that, in these cells, VT-1 induces apoptosis via a caspase- and mitochondria-dependent pathway. In this report, we provide new insights into this signal transduction pathway. First, we demonstrate that VT-1-induced apoptosis requires degradation of the caspase-8 inhibitory molecule c-FLIPL and that this degradation occurs through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we show that mitochondrial activation is mainly due to i) cleavage and activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid by caspase-8 and ii) Bax relocalization to mitochondrial membranes which lead to cytochrome c release. However, tBid is not involved in Bax relocalization, and relocalization is most likely controlled by the extent of Bax phosphorylation: in non-treated BL cells, p38 MAPK participates in the retention of Bax in the cytoplasm in an inactive form whereas in VT-1 treated cells, protein phosphatase 2A is activated and induces Bax relocalization to mitochondria.}

abstract = {We consider the revenue management problem of capacity control under customer choice behavior. An exact solution of the underlying stochastic dynamic program is difficult because of the multi-dimensional state space and, thus, approximate dynamic programming (ADP) techniques are widely used. The key idea of ADP is to encode the multi-dimensional state space by a small number of basis functions, often leading to a parametric approximation of the dynamic program’s value function. In general, two classes of ADP techniques for learning value function approximations exist: mathematical programming and simulation. So far, the literature on capacity control largely focuses on the first class. In this paper, we develop a least squares approximate policy iteration (API) approach which belongs to the second class. Thereby, we suggest value function approximations that are linear in the parameters, and we estimate the parameters via linear least squares regression. Exploiting both exact and heuristic knowledge from the value function, we enforce structural constraints on the parameters to facilitate learning a good policy. We perform an extensive simulation study to investigate the performance of our approach. The results show that it is able to obtain competitive revenues compared to and often outperforms state-of-the-art capacity control methods in reasonable computational time. Depending on the scarcity of capacity and the point in time, revenue improvements of around 1% or more can be observed. Furthermore, the proposed approach contributes to simulation-based ADP, bringing forth research on numerically estimating piecewise linear value function approximations and their application in revenue management environments.}

To synthesise the current literature, we conducted a meta-analysis of 48 studies to determine if BID differed between lesbian versus heterosexual women, lesbian women versus gay men, and gay versus heterosexual men. Body image measures were grouped according to similarities in constructs measured, resulting in five different categories (global satisfaction, figural-rating scales, cognitive measures, affect measures, and male body image). The results indicated that lesbian women reported experiencing less BID compared to heterosexual women on measures of global satisfaction, but more compared to gay men, and gay men reported experiencing greater BID compared to heterosexual men on three out of five analyses. Moderation analyses indicated that the study quality was not a statistically significant moderator of the effect sizes. Results from this updated meta-analysis indicate that, to some degree, BIDs affect individuals regardless of gender and sexual orientation; however, there is some variability associated with sexual orientation.}

The proposed framework differentiates among different sizes of contractors and uses a reasoning model that goes deeply into the heart of the decision making process. Hence, it helps to clarify the complex picture regarding the two sequential decisions and allows the users to follow the methodology used and the steps followed in reaching the final decisions. In order to see the degree to which SCBMD mirrors actual industry practices, it was implemented to 100 different real bidding situations. An accuracy of 86% was reached in simulating actual bid/no bid decisions of the contractors while the average difference in markup percentages proposed by the software and the contractors was found as 1.75%. Moreover, the software was evaluated for its timeliness under varying bidding conditions and found very effective especially for the cases where the contractor would like to reach decision alternatives for different possible scenarios of the same bidding situation.}

This study proposes and finds a large interaction effect between the impacts of core-relatedness and multiple bidders on tender offer premiums. The presence of multiple bidders is found to have a greater impact on tender offer premiums when the eventual acquirer is not core-related to the target. In other words, acquirers that are not core-related to the firms they purchase, tend to pay very high premiums when multiple bidders compete for the target. Results show that the direct relationships between core-relatedness and premiums as well as the direct relationship between multiple bidders and premiums depends on the state of the interaction effect.}

The final result of these markets sets the production scheduling for the operation time, including a power commitment from the wind generators. However, wind resources are uncertain, and the final power delivered usually differs from the initial power committed. This imbalance produces an overcost in the system, which must be paid by those who produce it, e.g., wind generators among others. As a result, wind farm revenue decreases, but it could increase by allowing wind farms to submit their bids to the markets together with a hydro generating unit, which may easily modify its production according to the expected imbalance. This paper presents a stochastic optimization technique that maximizes the joint profit of hydro and wind generators in a pool-based electricity market, taking into account the uncertainty of wind power prediction.}

This chapter presents the various aspects of preparing the bid documents. Depending on the type of contract to be awarded, a slightly different set of bid documents will be required: one for a lump-sum contract award, one for a cost-plus contract, one for a construction-manager contract, and one for design-build. The bid documents should include a provision requiring the contractor to furnish his or her past five-year safety record and workers' compensation experience modification rate, which is the “multiplier” used in establishing the workers' compensation insurance rates based on previous accident rates. A modification rate that is lower than 1.0 would be deemed acceptable. In most construction contracts, the general contractor is required to furnish all insurance coverage as required by that contract, and in turn he or she requires the subcontractors to comply with specific insurance requirements, so there are several layers of often repetitive coverage and associated costs. The bid documents are the place where instructions can be included that will allow the owner to better evaluate each contractor's bid. The general conditions, evaluation of the bid, and contractor selection are also elaborated.}

The goal is to predict whether an individual auction item in a certain round will be sold or not. A simple linear regression and the least angle regression (LARS) containing random effect terms were used to select meaningful variables for our logit model. The link function of the proposed logit model is represented by two bundles of parameters. The former part consists of the parameters whose values do not change over rounds. The latter part has parameters whose values interact with rounds. The observed data corresponding to an appraiser price as well as an intercept term reflecting local characteristics are used without any change. Data that corresponds to all the other parameters is not directly used, but transformed based on similarities between the original item and the surrounding auction items being recommended by the court auction experts. We tested the Bayesian logistic regression by establishing different priors: Dunson’s prior, Gelman’s prior and Ansari’s prior. Dunson’s prior was found to perform the best. Little significant difference was found between the results of the other two priors. These findings indicate that logistic regression taking the heterogeneity of multi-round into account performs better than a one-layered neural network over all time periods.}

While the removal of the mandatory bid rule can increase potential gains from control, it can also weaken protection for minority shareholders. We provide evidence that the latter effect dominates by showing that the premium increases (decreases) in response to enhancement (lowering) of investor protection via regulatory alterations in the rule. The premium is lower in government-owned firms, which may be an indicator that control transfers, that allow benefits from the mandatory bid rule to accrue to minority shareholders, are less likely in government-owned firms. We also find that the premium is inversely related to an index designed to capture the firm's corporate governance practices. The results suggest that expropriations of minority shareholders are more likely at firms with poor corporate governance provisions and weak takeover rules relating to mandatory bids.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a permissive hypoxaemic target for an oxygen saturation of 90% for children with bronchiolitis, which is consistent with the WHO recommendations for targets in children with lower respiratory tract infections. No evidence exists to support this threshold. We aimed to assess whether the 90% or higher target for management of oxygen supplementation was equivalent to a normoxic 94% or higher target for infants admitted to hospital with viral bronchiolitis.
Methods
We did a parallel-group, randomised, controlled, equivalence trial of infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months of age with physician-diagnosed bronchiolitis newly admitted into eight paediatric hospital units in the UK (the Bronchiolitis of Infancy Discharge Study [BIDS]). A central computer randomly allocated (1:1) infants, in varying length blocks of four and six and without stratification, to be clipped to standard oximeters (patients treated with oxygen if pulse oxygen saturation [SpO2] <94%) or modified oximeters (displayed a measured value of 90% as 94%, therefore oxygen not given until SpO2 <90%). All parents, clinical staff, and outcome assessors were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was time to resolution of cough (prespecified equivalence limits of plus or minus 2 days) in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN28405428.
Findings
Between Oct 3, and March 30, 2012, and Oct 1, and March 29, 2013, we randomly assigned 308 infants to standard oximeters and 307 infants to modified oximeters. Cough resolved by 15·0 days (median) in both groups (95% CI for difference −1 to 2) and so oxygen thresholds were equivalent. We recorded 35 serious adverse events in 32 infants in the standard care group and 25 serious adverse events in 24 infants in the modified care group. In the standard care group, eight infants transferred to a high-dependency unit, 23 were readmitted, and one had a prolonged hospital stay. In the modified care group, 12 infants were transferred to a high-dependency unit and 12 were readmitted to hospital. Recorded adverse events did not differ significantly.
Interpretation
Management of infants with bronchiolitis to an oxygen saturation target of 90% or higher is as safe and clinically effective as one of 94% or higher. Future research should assess the benefits and risks of different oxygen saturation targets in acute respiratory infection in older children, particularly in developing nations where resources are scarce.

Further, the mean value of high bonus bids for deepwater leases is also found to be significantly higher than that of shallow water leases. The results also suggest that variation in crude petroleum price index may lead to a higher mean value of the high bids, certeris paribus.}

We exploit the fact that the scoring weights of these award criteria changed in the time period under consideration, while the classification of worker types remained similar. Our estimation results show that increases in the scoring weights of the quality components (vis-à-vis the price weight) result in higher price bids. We also find that a higher weight for both the reputation component and the methodology component contributes to the job-placement of workers.}

We use a clustering algorithm to group artists that represent similar styles. This algorithm is specifically well-suited for situations where statistical distributions are far from normal – a description we believe fits well with markets for art. We test the method empirically on a ten-year sample of price data for paintings by 58 artists. Even with this limited data set, we clearly identify five groups and show that these are related to a standard classification of style.}

Res. 143(1) (2002) 171] proposes a buyer–seller game model that evaluates the efficiency of alternative bids with respect to the ideal target set by the buyer. The current paper shows that this buyer–seller game model is closely related to data envelopment analysis (DEA) and can be simplified. The current paper also shows that setting the (ideal) target actually incorporates implicit tradeoff information on the multiple attributes into efficiency evaluation. We develop a new buyer–seller game model where the efficiency is maximized with respect to multiple targets set by the buyer. The new model allows the buyer to evaluate and select the vendors in the context of best-practice. By both minimizing and maximizing efficiency, the buyer can obtain an efficiency range within which the true efficiency lies given the implicit tradeoff information characterized by the targets. The current study establishes the linkage between buyer–seller game models and DEA. Such a linkage can provide the buyer with correct evaluation methods based upon existing DEA models regarding the nature of bidding.}

However, fewer occurred in commenting contexts, and they were less likely to rely on purely conventional means. Their sons accepted fewer bids, and they more often appeared unaware of a bid.

abstract = {This paper develops a dynamic market microstructure model of liquidity provision in which M strategic market makers compete in price schedules for order flow from informed and uninformed traders. In equilibrium, market makers post price schedules that are steeper than efficient ones, and the market bid–ask spreads can be decomposed into two components, one due to adverse selection and the other due to imperfect competition. At any time, the two components are proportional to each other with a coefficient of proportionality depending on M. Several testable hypothesis are derived regarding the time-series and cross-sectional properties of prices and the bid–ask spreads. In particular, a new empirical measure of market competitiveness is proposed which can be estimated from the history of transaction prices and trading volumes. Finally, the properties of continuous market are also investigated.}

abstract = {In the last decade, the maintenance and operation environment within Saudi Arabia went through many changes. These changes have been caused by different factors including; the decline of oil incomes, delays in monthly payments, and the cancellation of government loans given to contractors. These factors had a great impact on the willingness of contractors to bid for the maintenance and operation projects. The study examines the bidding nature of maintenance and operation projects in Saudi Arabia. It also demonstrates the general distribution of number of bidders according to the types and sizes of maintenance and operation projects. It will determine the most attractive type and size among those projects. Data was collected from government sectors representing all the regions of the Kingdom. Two methods of data analysis were used: the summary statistics analyses that illustrate the central tendency and dispersion of data, and special statistics testing methods through which means differences of individual group of data can be examined. The analysis shows that, the average number of bidders fluctuates and significantly different according to the type and size of projects. The average number of bidders was found to increase as the project size increases. By presenting such issues, both clients and contractors knowledge of bidding characteristics are improved. Decline or fluctuation in number of bidders should have negative impacts on the long run whether on the bidding prices or on giving a chance to more unqualified contractors to engage into maintenance and operation enterprise.}

The bid valuation and construction problem for carriers facing these combinatorial auctions is very difficult and involves the computation of a number of NP-hard sub problems. In this paper we examine computationally tractable approximation methods for estimating these values and constructing bids. The benefit of our approximation method is that it provides a way for carriers to discover their true costs and construct optimal or near optimal bids by solving a single NP-hard problem. This represents a significant improvement in computational efficiency. We examine our method both analytically and empirically using a simulation based analysis.}

The literature suggests that there are a number of constraints and barriers to resource reuse, but perhaps the most critical one is the lack of easily accessible information about resource availability and usability. The emerging industries of building materials reuse and de-construction in the United States suffers from the absence of a “system” that would streamline business processes, establish a supply-demand chain, and connect vendors and deconstruction contractors with architects. This research derives an innovative restructuring of the architectural design process that enables resource reuse in new construction. We developed this model by capturing expert knowledge using a Delphi research protocol and mapped the Building Materials Reuse Workflow in Business Process Modeling and Notation language. We set out the knowledgebase requirements that should be integrated with Building Information Modeling to support decision-making by architects and project stakeholders.}

In this research, we discuss reserve price shilling, where a bidder shills in order to avoid paying auction house fees, rather than to drive up the price of the final bid. We examine the effect that premium bids have upon the final selling price, since they are linked with reserve price shill bids. We use 10,260 eBay auctions during April 2001, and identify 919 auctions involving 322 sellers and 1583 bidders involved in concurrent auctions for the exact same item. We find that premium bidding occurs 23% of the time, in 263 of the 919 auctions. Using a theoretical perspective involving valuation signals, we show that other bidders may view high bids as signals that an item is worth more. Thus, they may be willing to pay more for the items than others that do not receive premium bids. The implications are disturbing in that sellers may be more motivated to enter a shill bid in order to drive up the final price in an online auction. We also examine and report on alternative hypotheses involving winner’s curse and the possibility of reserve price shill bids. Our results are developed in the context of a weighted least squares regression model that predicts an item selling price-to-average selling price ratio.}

Economic theories of contract selection suggest that Design-Build would fit better with large, environmentally uncertain, and technologically challenging projects, thereby, requiring better-qualified contractors. However, analyses of comprehensive data on public transportation projects in Florida reveal some misfits between theories and the reality. Regardless, Design-Build seems advantageous to schedule control, while cost advantages of one method over the other is still inconclusive. This study concludes with some implications of these findings for efficient deliveries of public infrastructure projects.}

The results support Brock and Kleidon's distinguishing implications — namely, increased trading volume raises the ask and lowers the bid, and a Hausman-type specification test fails to reject the exogeneity of order flows at the bid and the ask. Also, greater price volatility within a fifteen minute interval leads to both lower bids and lower asks as buyers are accorded a risk premium, consistent with Brown, Harlow and Tinic's (Journal of Financial Economics, 22 (1988) 355–385) uncertain information hypothesis for efficient markets.}

Thus, when bidder gains are regressed on the predicted values of institutional ownership in two-stage regressions, the recursive estimates do not confirm the relationship shown by the OLS regressions. Furthermore, we do not find any evidence that active institutional investors (e.g., CalPERS) as a group enhance efficiency in the market for corporate control.

A natural log transformation of the low bid and final cost was found to produce regression models for each agency that had high R and R2 values. These models can predict completed project cost using only the project low bid as input. A separate regression model was determined for each agency. Based on the form of the calculated models it appears that highway agencies construct projects where the final cost increases as an increasing percentage of the low bid price as the project magnitude increases. The dredging projects appear to follow different mechanisms of cost increase than the highway projects and were not predicted as well by the regression models. The regression models can also be used for budgeting purposes by submitting the sum of the low bids for a group of projects as input. The regression models output a prediction of the cost of the group of projects that was found to be highly accurate.}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive ontology framework that allows the specification of bids for Web-based markets. By expressing utility function policies with a logic-based and standardized formalism, the framework enables a compact bid representation particularly for highly configurable goods and services while ensuring a high degree of interoperability. To facilitate matchmaking of offers and requests in the market, a method for evaluating bids based on logical reasoning is presented.

One hundred fifty-two patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD or levobunolol BID for 6 weeks, followed by a crossover to the alternate treatment. IOP and heart rate were measured at morning trough and peak during weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD was comparable to levobunolol BID in reducing IOP at peak and trough. Although the effects on peak heart rate were similar between the two medications, the effect on trough heart rate of timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD was significantly less than that of levobunolol BID (P = 0.001).

Overall, more patients experienced at least one adverse event when using timolol maleate gel-forming solution. Timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD is as efficacious in reducing IOP as levobunolol BID.}

For some, the pursuit of the games embodies Toronto’s transformation into a ‘competitive’ global city. Relatively unexplored in this discourse are the contradictory roles that labour plays in contemporary urban development. I argue that the new labour geography can provide some interesting insights into such processes. Specifically, labour geographers have given workers with divergent interests greater agency in shaping economic landscapes and have noted the multi-scalar organisation of labour. The paper looks at the contradictory and conflicting positions held by different labour unions in Toronto toward the city’s bid to host the 2008 Olympics. The case study suggests that labour is an active agent in processes shaping contemporary Toronto and support the bid for complex reasons ranging from the promise of jobs to potential future organising opportunities.}

VC-backed firms also experience a decline in quoted and effective spreads in the post-lockup period as compared to non-VC firms. Our empirical results show that insider selling and VC unwinding both improve liquidity after unlock day. However, only insider selling is associated with a reduction in the adverse selection component of spread.}

While the first CT, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Container Terminal, is operated by JNPT, the second and third CTs are being operated by DP World and an APM Terminals-CONCOR consortium respectively. The standalone CT too is operated by DP World while the fourth CT was awarded to PSA International and is under construction. The development of the CTs is a case study to understand how various conflicts have been addressed or accentuated by policy makers, legal and regulatory authorities, and the mechanisms used to resolve them. Following a case-based analytical approach, case studies, court judgements, published and unpublished papers, media reports, primary data from discussions, and secondary data have been examined to construct a chronological story of the bids for the five CTs during the twenty five years since the commissioning of the port in 1989. The concessioning of each CT to a private stakeholder involved contentious issues which prompted the authorities to revise policy guidelines periodically to address them. Consequent and prolonged litigation resulted in time and cost overruns. Various issues, like policy formulation, contractual rights versus policy guidelines, strategic risks, monopoly prevention versus scale economies, market risks, effect of elections, leadership changes, security clearances, mutuality and clarity in documentation, that emerged during the bidding processes, have been crystallised as lessons learnt.}

Firms from civil law countries and countries providing stronger investor protection tend to cross-list. The adoption of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 led to an increase in the propensity to be acquired for firms from civil law countries, and to a greater rate of cross-listings for capital intensive firms. M/B values of non-U.S. firms following cross-listing in the U.S. are lower when these firms were expected to be acquired. Similarly, non-U.S. targets and U.S. bidders experience lower abnormal returns in acquisitions involving targets expected to cross-list.

Furthermore, we modeled a complex of BCL-XL and BID by aligning the BID and BAK BH3 motifs in the known BCL-XL–BAK BH3 complex.

This chapter describes the experiences in building CAPTAINS (Crew Availability Planning and Training System) for the Royal Dutch airline company KLM. CAPTAINS is a complex application that enables a planner to maintain strategic, tactical, and operational models of pilot populations. A major problem in building the short-term planning algorithms for CAPTAINS was the prediction of pilot bid behavior. Twice a year pilots may express their preference for new seats (functions) and KLM is obliged to give a new seat to the most senior officer who is qualified. However, in some cases the bids are not known for the season for which one is planning. If a pilot changes his bid, this can influence the planning substantially; thus a correct prediction of pilot bid behavior is of vital importance for a good plan. Using genetic algorithms, one is able to produce rules that predict pilot bid behavior with an acceptable level of accuracy.}

In contrast to previous literature, both demand and production are stochastic. We develop a novel bid-price-based revenue management approach to solve this decision problem. The production system is modeled using clearing functions to capture the non-linear inter-dependency of workload and lead times in stochastic production systems. In extant literature, a common approach to cope with variability in a production system is to introduce fixed, workload-independent lead times. We show in a numerical study that our newly developed approach based on clearing functions clearly outperforms this fixed lead time approach.}

This paper presents an empirical investigation into the use and impact of post-bid takeover defences within recent UK hostile acquisitions. Specifically, using data from 56 contested takeover approaches, the study explores the impact of individual defence tactics on the eventual outcome of the takeover attempt, the bid premium offered to shareholders, and the level of executive retention within the target company. Statistical analysis reveals that ‘white knights’ and ‘management buy outs’ were the most effective takeover defences and suggests that other commonly employed defence tactics, including the lobbying of stakeholders and regulatory appeals, have a weak and indecisive impact on bid outcome. Furthermore, once in a contested situation, the capacity of executives to use takeover defences either to entrench themselves or to boost the bid premium for shareholders was found to be limited. The findings provide important insights for executives faced with a takeover approach.}

This study suggests that implementation of the one-dollar rule is justified for the following reasons: (1) NASDAQ stocks frequently trading below $1 during the pre-rule period are extremely vulnerable to catastrophic losses; (2) a dramatic decline in extreme loss probability is observed among low-priced (relative to $1) stocks after the rule was introduced; and (3) the $1 benchmark serves as an appropriate cutoff point in screening stocks listed on the exchange.}

The analysis procedure includes both predictability and correlation analysis of the most important load and price indices. The experimental data from Iran’s electricity market has been employed in its real size which is long enough to take properties such as non-stationarity of the market into account. For predictability, the characteristics of the hourly accepted Weighted Average Price (WAP) as the topmost price index of this market is analyzed. The analysis tools are time series analysis methods such as power spectral density analysis, phase space reconstruction and test of surrogates, the fractional dimension and the slope of integral sums and the recurrence plots. The results indicate a deterministic, un-stationary and seasonal behavior in addition to unstable periodic orbits and even chaotic behavior in WAP time series. These observations imply just short-term predictability of WAP behavior. The interactive behavior of WAP with the hourly required load (RL) is also considered. For this interaction analysis, in addition to the common correlation methods, cross and joint recurrence plot are also employed. The joint behavioral analysis represents an un-stationary mimic correlation between WAP and RL.}

It appears two criteria must be met for proapoptotic function within the BCL2 family: targeting of molecules to intracellular membranes, and exposure of the BH3 death domain. BID’s activity is regulated by a Caspase 8–mediated cleavage event, exposing the BH3 domain and significantly changing the surface charge and hydrophobicity, resulting in a change of cellular localization.}

In this approach assessments are described subjectively in linguistic terms, while screening criteria are weighted by their corresponding importance using fuzzy values. As an illustration, a practical example for evaluating a bid opportunity of an international co-development commercial airplane project in Taiwan is cited, which shows how this method can provide the analyst with more convincing and reliable results and cost saving for the company.}

abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have been rarely included in large-scale studies. This is arguably not due to a lack of information that lies in EEG recordings but mainly on account of methodological issues. In many cases, particularly in clinical, pediatric and aging populations, the EEG has a high degree of artifact contamination and the quality of EEG recordings often substantially differs between subjects. Although there exists a variety of standardized preprocessing methods to clean EEG from artifacts, currently there is no method to objectively quantify the quality of preprocessed EEG. This makes the commonly accepted procedure of excluding subjects from analyses due to exceeding contamination of artifacts highly subjective. As a consequence, P-hacking is fostered, the replicability of results is decreased, and it is difficult to pool data from different study sites. In addition, in large-scale studies, data are collected over years or even decades, requiring software that controls and manages the preprocessing of ongoing and dynamically growing studies. To address these challenges, we developed Automagic, an open-source MATLAB toolbox that acts as a wrapper to run currently available preprocessing methods and offers objective standardized quality assessment for growing studies. The software is compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard and hence facilitates data sharing. In the present paper we outline the functionality of Automagic and examine the effect of applying combinations of methods on a sample of resting and task-based EEG data. This examination suggests that applying a pipeline of algorithms to detect artifactual channels in combination with Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm (MARA), an independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact correction method, is sufficient to reduce a large extent of artifacts.}

We propose a general method of splitting the wholesale bid-ask spread into its three constituent components: the order processing costs, the adverse information costs and the inventory holding costs. The bid-ask spread reflects the extent of information asymmetry and order imbalance in the market place. However, the dynamics of the bid-ask spread can only be understood in terms of the movement of its components; hence the importance of isolating these components. We use Zellner's seemingly unrelated regressions to split the bid-ask spread into the three components in the rice markets of 14 major centers in India. The results are then linked to the production and consumption patterns in the market areas covered by these centers.}

abstract = {Background: Etizolam is an anxiolytic drug with a pharmacologic profile similar to that of the classic benzodiazepines. Neurochemical research suggests that etizolam may have selectivity for the subpopulation of Y-aminobutyric acid type A receptors associated with anxiety (ie, α1, β2, γ2). This property, plus its characterization as a ligand with fewer of the adverse events typical of full agonists (impaired cognitive function, tolerance, and dependence), led to its selection for this study. Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to test for the noninferiority of etizolam 0.5 mg BID versus placebo in affecting cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate anxiety disorder of recent onset (<1 month). Anxiety measures and tolerability were also assessed. Methods: Patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years were eligible for enrollment. This doubleblind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 5 centers in Italy using a 2-treatment, 3-period crossover design. Patients were randomized to 3-week sequences of either etizolam-placebo-placebo or placebo-etizolam-etizolam. They were evaluated at 4 scheduled visits (screening and days 7, 14, and 21). Cognitive function was assessed using scores from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Digit Span test (total forward and backward scores and the time required to perform the test). Anxiety was measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for screening and to monitor adequacy of therapy. Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and adverse events were also recorded. Results: A total of 77 white patients were enrolled (mean age, 33.3 years [range, 22–60 years]; 62.3% female; mean weight, 65.2 kg). With a power of 0.80, the difference between the effects of etizolam and placebo on WAIS Digit Span performance was not significant for total score (0.102 [90% CI, −0.130 to 0.335]) or time required for completion (0.029 second [90% CI, −0.574 to 0.632]). Anxiety, as measured using the HAM-A and STAI instruments, did not differ significantly between groups. No significant differences were found between etizolam 0.5 mg BID and placebo for cardiovascular events, weight changes, or adverse events. Mild or moderate somnolence was reported by 7 of 77 patients (9.1% [3 patients while receiving etizolam and 4 patients while receiving etizolam and placebo]). Conclusions: No significant differences between etizolam 0.5 mg BID and placebo were found for cognitive function or anxiety measures in these patients with anxiety. Etizolam was well tolerated.}

Stock returns are negatively associated with an increase in both global and industrial diversification. Cross-border takeover activity has increased during the past decade and the observed difference in bidder gains is more pronounced for the latter half of the sample period. We find that bidder returns are positively related to takeover activity in the target country and to a legal system offering better shareholder rights. With the exception of the UK, the target country's degree of economic restrictiveness is negatively related to bidder returns.}

These studies concluded that inventory and adverse-selection costs were economically insignificant compared to order-processing costs. Natural questions arise as to: (i) whether price discreteness allowed market makers to enjoy excess rents, thus reducing the significance of the inventory and adverse selection costs; (ii) whether discreteness decreased the traders' incentives to gather information; or (iii) whether methodologies previously employed mis-estimated the inventory and the adverse-selection costs. We show that the recent conversion to decimal pricing results in significantly tighter spreads. However, the dollar value of spreads attributed to adverse selection and inventory costs do not change significantly. Almost all of the reduction occurs in the order-processing component. As a result, inventory and adverse-selection costs now account for a significantly larger proportion of the traded spreads. A plausible explanation is that the minimum tick size constraint previously in place under fractional pricing allowed market makers to enjoy spreads that were larger than their actual costs.}

To solve the resulting multi-objective decision-making problem, the paper proposes a binary goal programming model. When tested with the existing contractor selection procedure for six past projects in RDD, the model yields the same results as those taken by RDD in the past, confirming the credibility of the model. When tested with the suggested procedure, the model yields much superior results.}

Using the 95 cases obtained from the Turkish contractors working in international markets, a case-based reasoning model (CBR) has been developed to estimate the risk, opportunity and competition ratings. These ratings are further converted to risk and profit mark-up values by using linear utility functions constructed according to the boundary values which were identified by the respondents considering worst, average and best scenarios. The applicability of the model has been demonstrated on a real case study.}

Buyers in these markets sell the fish they purchase on a retail market. The paper provides an original model of boundedly rational behavior for wholesale buyers׳ behavior incorporating learning to improve profits, conjectures as to the bids that will be made and fictitious learning. We analyze the dynamics of the aggregate price under different market conditions in order to explain the emergence of market price patterns such as the well-known declining price paradox and the empirically observed fact that the very last transactions in the day may be at a higher price. The proposed behavioral model provides alternative explanations for market price dynamics to those which depend on standard hypotheses such as diminishing marginal profits. Furthermore, agents learn the option value of having the possibility of bidding in later rounds. When confronted with random buyers, such as occasional participants or new entrants, they learn to bid in the optimal way without being conscious of the strategies of the other buyers. When faced with other buyers who are also learning their behavior still displays some of the characteristics learned in the simpler case even though the problem is not analytically tractable.}

We find that firms that defeated takeover bids after July 1989 shifted away from the use of active takeover defenses (repurchases, special dividends, greenmail, and leverage increases). Nevertheless, shareholders of firms that defeat a takeover experienced slightly better wealth outcomes in the 1990s than in the 1980s.

abstract = {Background
The global clinical and economic burden of type 2 diabetes is substantial. Recently, clinical trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (liraglutide and exenatide) have shown a multifactorial clinical profile with the potential to address many of the clinical needs of patients and reduce the burden of disease.
Objective
The goal of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-daily liraglutide versus exenatide BID in patients with type 2 diabetes who failed to improve with metformin and/or sulfonylurea, based on the results of a previous clinical trial in 6 European countries (Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, and Austria).
Methods
A validated computer simulation model of diabetes was used to predict life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incidence of diabetes-related complications in patients receiving liraglutide (1.8 mg once daily) or exenatide (10 μg BID). Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were derived from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes 6 trial. Country-specific complication costs were taken from published sources. Simulations were run over 40 years from third-party payer perspectives. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at country-specific discount rates. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
Results
Liraglutide was associated with improvements of 0.12 to 0.17 QALY and a reduced incidence of most diabetes-related complications versus exenatide in all settings. Evaluation of total direct medical costs (treatment plus complication costs) suggest that liraglutide was likely to cost between Euro (€) 1023 and €1866 more than exenatide over patients' lifetimes, leading to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per QALY gained versus exenatide of: Switzerland, CHF (Swiss francs) 10,950 (€6902); Denmark, Danish krone [kr] 88,160 (€11,805); Norway, Norwegian krone [kr], 111,916 (€13,546); Finland, €8459; the Netherlands, €8119; and Austria, €8516.
Conclusions
Long-term projections indicated that liraglutide was associated with benefits in life expectancy, QALYs, and reduced complication rates versus exenatide. Liraglutide was cost-effective from a health care payer perspective in Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, and Austria. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT 00518882.}

abstract = {Much of the literature on value for money (VFM) evaluation of private finance initiative (PFI) contracts has concentrated on the financial methodology of constructing the public sector comparator (PSC) and its limitations. In contrast, this paper focuses on examining how ‘PFI bids’ are actually evaluated for VFM in the case of three secondary school PFI contracts. It is a unique study which presents the Northern Ireland school PFI decision-making processes, within the broader UK context. It is based on the full business cases of three PFI schools and interviews with key actors involved in the PFI processes. This study shows that the methodology used to evaluate and benchmark the design, facilities management, financial and contractual aspects of PFI bids for VFM is subjective and problematic-changes in the assumptions used may easily shift the balance in favour of conventional procurement and/or competing private sector service providers. It further highlights the importance of risk transfer; how non-financial factors are taken into consideration; and the public sector's reliance on consulting firms and ‘accounting measures’ in the PFI decision-making processes.}

abstract = {The main idea of this research is to devise the smart module to pick the best supplier bid(s) automatically. The hybrid model is composed of three useful tools: fuzzy logic, AHP, and QFD. The approach has been carefully implemented and verified via a real-world case study in a medium-to-large industry manufacturing vehicle tires and other rubber products. A collection of 12 assessment criteria classified into two categories have been considered. Eight factors are derived from customer suggestions and the other four are design specifications required to manufacture the product. The main outcomes are: a hybrid autonomous model to evaluate supplier bids without direct human intervention; devising a hybrid three-module method and overcoming complexity of computations in resulting algorithm by means of agents; outlining the best criteria to assess suppliers; evaluating the suppliers based on voice of customer during all stages of the process; and discussing analysis, design, and implementation issues of the evaluation agent. The paper includes implications for development of an integrated total system for supply chain coordination. The most important advantages of this work over earlier researches on supplier selection are: implementation of an autonomous assessment mechanism using intelligent agents for the first time, making the best out of three widely applied methodologies all at once, evaluation process mainly based on features of customer order, coordination of supply job based on a bidding system, and portal-mediated operation and control.}

abstract = {Most important construction problems facing building operations are how to choose a contractor specialized in implementing major projects. In addition to that the increasing costs of raw materials, work force leading to the rise of construction costs. Therefore in this paper hierarchy method has been studied and it has been identified for organizations allowing them to minimize common risks of the decision-making process and management. Construction contractor can be prequalification using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) as powerful management technique. Prequalification contractor aims at eliminating in competent contractors in the bidding process. This kind of prequalification helps both of the public and private project owners to successful achieve for required project tasks. The project will be completed with is estimated cost and time because of the contractor's skill, capability and efficiency. Case study gathers a number of contractor's or companies data. After studying Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) of a set of criteria, table of contractor's technical evaluation was concluded all experience, financial situation and the contractor's classification in the Union of Contractors. In addition labor's progress, availability equipment for contractor is applied using Value Engineering (VE) to raise the performance level and reducing costs. Hence, value engineering will be demonstrated, where its goal is to raise the performance level and functionality with the ability to reduce costs. The case study of this paper is a construction project of a hospital, administration building, and staff housing building. It was applied the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and was extracted contractor's evaluation table of a set of criteria (the previous experience, financial situation and the contractor's classification in the Union of Contractors. Also labor's progress, available equipment for the contractor and the contractor applying Value Engineering). The previous data are gathered through the contractor's proposal, while (VE) is applied as process steps on a construction project case study.}

The method of this research is semi-experimental type that has been done on experimental and control groups. Celburg and healer general health questionnaire GHQ-28 has been used in this study. This questionnaire has four dimensions (Physical Complaint, Anxiety, Disorder in Social adequacy, Depression).Also by using hydrotherapy exercise in the format of aerobic exercise the experimental group was practiced in swimming pool. The statistical society for the study is all the 40-50 years old male employees (n=200) in the Bid boland gas purge company that after calculating the mean of mental health scores (mean=50.69) and also standard deviation (SD=13.88) in statistical population, with one and half SD higher than average (50.69+(1.5×13.88), 40 participants were selected and then these people randomly divided into 2 experimental(n=20) and control(n=20) groups. Analyzing of data was performed by computer and using spss software and statistical method of independent-sample t-test. Considering the study findings showed that hydrotherapy exercise of running in water with intensity of 60% to 70% of Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) has a positive effect on mental health and its dimension. Since level of hormones such as nor epinephrine, serotonin and dopamine is low in body of some one who is suffering than depression and anxiety. It seems that hydrotherapy exercise could increase level of these hormones. (Gaszkow,2004)suggest to person who is suffering than depression,anxiety that for decrease depression and anxiety and another disorders do hydrotherapy exercise in swimming pool with intensity of optimal aerobic exercise that was suggested by researcher.(Netz,2005). In addition, when exercise is done in water the persons have at least pressure on their joints in compare with do exercise in out of water and also have goog feel.}

We find that women bid significantly higher and earn significantly less than men do in the first-price auction, while we find no evidence of a gender difference in bidding or earnings in the second-price auction. Focusing on the first-price auction, we find that, while the gender gap in bidding and earnings persists over the entire course of the menstrual cycle, bidding of contraceptive pill users follows a sine-like pattern throughout the menstrual cycle, with higher than average bidding in the follicular phase and lower than average bidding in the luteal phase. In comparison, pill non-users have a flat bidding profile throughout the cycle.}
