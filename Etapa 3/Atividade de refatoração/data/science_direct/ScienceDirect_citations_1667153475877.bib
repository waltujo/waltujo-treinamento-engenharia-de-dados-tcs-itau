abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of auctioning a kind of continuous homogeneous divisible goods, and present a multi-stage sequential auction mechanism of divisible goods under uniform price. In this mechanism, the auction process is divided into multiple stages, all bidders satisfy the sequential rationality conditions, all bidders are asymmetric, every bidder is allowed to submit a nonincreasing continuous demand function in each round bidding, every bidder’s valuation to per unit of the goods is independent private information, and if a bidder does not obtain the quantity he wants in former stage auction, he still have another opportunity to obtain some quantity in the later stage auction. For this mechanism, we explore the formation process and composition of equilibrium points in each stage auction, and discuss the optimal strategy selection for bidders, then give the detail steps and an application example to show how to implement this multi-stage sequential auction mechanism. The conclusions can be drawn that our auction mechanism is an efficient incentive mechanism, and can effectively reduce many underpricing equilibrium and can yield higher expected income than a single uniform price auction for the auctioneer. It also can avoid the occurrence of failure auction (equilibrium does not exist), and effectively extend and improve the traditional single stage uniform price auction mechanism.}

Economically, an inter-quartile range increase in vega translates into an approximately 4.22% enhancement in acquisition investments, consistent with the theory that risk-taking incentives induce CEOs to undertake investments. Importantly, the positive relation between vega and acquisitions is confined only to non-overconfident CEO subgroup. Further, corporate governance does not generally affect the association between vega and acquisition investments. Finally, vega is positively related to bidder announcement returns.}

abstract = {The affordability and increased capability of additive manufacturing machines has spawned prototyping service bureaus throughout the world. This poses a challenge to designers who are looking to obtain quality 3D printed parts at best available prices within fastest turnaround times. Customers relying on a sole source for 3D printed parts may have limited options in obtaining the best deals. From a service supplier point of view, filling excess capacity will require significant marketing budgets to reach and retain customers. In this paper, we present a novel mechanism design approach for improving the accessibility of prototyping services providers by leveraging their excess capacity. In our proposed mechanism, consumers name their own price and the mechanism will find service bureaus who are willing to make the part under the stated price. The mechanism runs similar to a reverse auction where consumers bid and the platform finds a service supplier which is able to match the stated bid price. The incentive for suppliers to participate in such a platform is the opportunity to market their excess capacity to a deal conscious consumer at a lower price without cannibalizing their existing sales channels. Qualified suppliers do not directly compete with each other for any given order since they are chosen using a two stage selection process by the service platform. This algorithm ensures that every supplier has a fair chance of selling its services on the platform regardless of price. We implement the proposed mechanism design approach in a simulated service marketplace and empirically evaluate the marketplace behavior by studying the impact of various model factors such as the supplier threshold price, the size and variety of suppliers in the marketplace.}

The patterns in the data are consistent with cartel distortions persisting in the post-cartel period, possibly due to the presence of long-term contracts. An implication is that, in addition to terminating involvement in cartel activity, some social benefit may accrue from requiring firms seeking leniency to mitigate the harm caused by cartel actions.}

In auction theory, the joint bidding effect depends on theories. If joint bidding reduces barriers to entry for potential bidders with limited financial and technical resources, it is pro-competitive. When bidders exploit collusive schemes under cover of joint bidding, the anti-competitive effect is realized. By the OLS and treatment effect models, I found that joint bidding in general does not foster competition, but it has a competitive effect on local firms in developing countries. J. Japanese Int.

Therefore, public clients have started to promote new strategies, embracing innovative approaches such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and e-Procurement. Tendering plays a key role for the success of the overall process; however, the selection of the best contractor is still a difficult task. The paper investigates how tendering can be integrated with Model Checking in order to control the compliance between the client's requirements and bidders’ offers within a digital environment. The research shows that, although the BIM is still not widely adopted in tendering procedures, Model Checking tools are already available to support the jury, as well as bidders. Moreover, even though BIM can be implemented in several procurement procedures, it is more effective if a collaborative and integrated behaviour is promoted. Results can help increase public clients’ awareness of the limits and potentials of an innovative approach and to set BIM requirements and guidelines.}

The results are consistent with and add to the theoretical literature whereas practical implications for port authorities, managers and investors are discussed.}

In an auction, it contains call for auction, bid construction, modify bids and winner announcement. A reference matrix is also applied in the auction to guarantee parts to finish as early as possible. Numerical experiments were conducted to test the auction-based approach.

The consumers were informed of the different storage durations, and were given the opportunity to purchase apples using their own money. Midway through the experimental market (which was run like an auction), the consumers were allowed to taste the apples. While the ‘New apples’ had been stored for a shorter duration, they were of poorer texture than the ‘Old apples’—this was confirmed by penetrometer tests, which gave mean values of 68 and 84N, respectively. ‘New apples’ were preferred over ‘Old apples’ by 90% of consumers, but this dropped to 60% after tasting. The mean price consumers bid to exchange ‘Old’ for ‘New’ apples was $ 0.76kg−1, and this did not change significantly after tasting. However, opinions on monetary value were polarized after tasting. Some consumers dropped their bids to $ 0, while others placed even higher bids. One participant stated: “I don’t want to feed my children apples that are 8 months old – I want them to have fresh healthy apples!” A ‘thought listing’ procedure elicited participants’ opinions on fruit quality and their reasons for changes in willingness-to-pay (WTP) for apples. The results are discussed in relation to the marked change in WTP that occurred following tasting for participants who assessed monetary value on the basis of sensory attributes compared with those whose value was based on knowledge of storage duration. Overall, this study demonstrates that both sensory and emotional aspects to consumer assessments of freshness influence consumer perceptions of monetary value of apples.}

The research is introduced through a discussion of capital plant manufacture and the factors underlying the management of technical engineering data. Although sales and engineering departments in the capital plant industry are equipped with data processing systems, evidence shows that much information processing is carried out manually, that computer systems are not integrated and that data has to be entered repeatedly at various stages of the bidding, design and manufacturing process. These findings initiated a new approach to product configuration and project management for capital plant manufacture based on engineering data — Engineering Data Control (EDC). The process flow and product structure of the EDC reference architecture is explained to show how the bid and order handling process can be integrated. The core of the paper deals in detail with the generic data structure and system reference architecture developed. An IDEF1X data model was developed to apply the generic reference architecture at a case study site. The suitability of EDC to increase information quality and to provide a concurrent engineering environment integrating all stages of a project life-cycle is discussed. The paper concludes by providing a critical review of the pertinent elements of the EDC reference architecture: the product structure view, the project stages view and the engineering data view.}

While the focus is typically on the improvements in resource allocation that are generated, these instruments also play an important role in addressing issues of asymmetric information. The use of water quality tenders to reveal the opportunity costs of changing agricultural practices can help policy makers to understand the potential costs of misallocating public resources and to design better ways of achieving water quality improvements. This role of water quality tenders to reveal opportunity costs is demonstrated by reporting four pilot applications to improve water quality into the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. The results demonstrate the potential for opportunity costs to vary substantially between agricultural producers, and across industries, catchments and pollutants. The results from these case studies indicate that the most cost-effective water quality improvements may be generated from the horticulture and dairy sectors. In contrast, the opportunity costs of reducing emissions from the cane and grazing industries appear to be higher.}

abstract = {Introduction HMPL-689 is a potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-delta (PI3Kδ). Despite available agents targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway, there remains a need for alternative therapies in the relapsed/refractory (R/R) setting due to agent-specific toxicities and suboptimal efficacy among lymphoma subtypes. This study (NCT03128164) is a phase 1, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study in China to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of HMPL-689 as a monotherapy in patients with R/R lymphomas. Here we present the preliminary results of the dose-escalation phase of the study. Methods In this dose escalation phase, patients with R/R lymphoma failed of standard therapy, at least 1 prior therapy, were eligible. The dose-escalation study consisted of cohort A (BID) and cohort B (QD), in which HMPL-689 was orally administered continuously on a 28-day cycle. The modified toxicity probability interval scheme-2 (mTPI-2) design was applied for the dose escalation and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determination. Blood samples for PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) analyses were collected during Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each subsequent cycle. Results A total of 56 patients were enrolled, with 5 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), 23 follicular lymphoma (FL), 7 marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), 9 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 9 diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and 3 Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients (Table 1). The median age was 56 years (range 26-73). The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range 1-8), of which 39 patients had prior exposure to rituximab. 29 patients received HMPL-689 in cohort A (BID): 2.5 mg (n=3), 5 mg (n=9), 7.5 mg (n=8), and 10 mg (n=9), while 27 patients were in cohort B (QD): 5 mg (n=3), 10 mg (n=3), 20 mg (n=9), 30 mg (n=9), and 40 mg (n=3). Median duration of HMPL-689 therapy was 7.6 months (range 0.4 -Not reached [NR]). The most common Grade ≥3 non-hematologic treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were pneumonia and hypertension. Grade ≥3 hematologic TEAEs were neutropenia (Table 2). No Grade 5 TEAE was reported. In cohort A, 4 dose limited toxicities (DLTs) were observed, including Grade 3 asymptomatic amylase (2 pts, 5 mg), Grade 4 hypercalcemia (1 pt, 10 mg), Grade 3 lipase increased (1 pt, 10 mg). In cohort B, 5 DLTs including Grade 3 skin maculopapular (1 pt, 20 mg), hypertriglyceridemia (1 pt, 30 mg), QT interval prolongation (1 pt, 30 mg) and rash (2 pts, 40 mg) were reported. Plasma PK data for the 5-30 mg QD and 2.5-10 mg BID multiple-dose regimens were determined. HMPL-689 drug exposures increased in a dose proportional fashion up to 30mg QD, as reflected in AUC and Cmax. The geometric mean AUCtau and Cmax at 30 mg QD in patients were approximately 2150 h•ng/mL and 260 ng/mL, respectively at steady state. The median Tmax was around 2 h and the arithmetic mean t1/2 was within the range of 5-10 hours, consistent across all dose levels. 51 out of the 56 patients had post-baseline tumor assessment, with 6 complete response (CR) (2 CLL/SLL, 4 FL), 21 partial responses (PR) (2 CLL/SLL, 5 MZL, 7 FL, 4 MCL, 3 DLBCL) and 18 stable disease (SD) (2 MZL, 9 FL, 4 MCL, 1 DLBCL, 2 HL). This resulted in 52.9% (27/51) objective response rate (ORR) in efficacy evaluable patients. The median time to response (TTR) and duration of response (DOR) were 3.5 months (1.8-8.4) and 6.4 months (0.7-NR), respectively (Table 3). One patient with FL who achieved CR (per post hoc independent radiologic review) was on treatment > 586 days. Final data quality control/verification is ongoing. As a result, 30 mg QD of HMPL-689 has been selected as recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on overall safety and tolerability, PK/PD and preliminary efficacy data. Conclusions: HMPL-689 was well tolerated and the RP2D was determined to be 30 mg QD orally. It exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, a manageable toxicity profile, and promising single-agent clinical activity in R/R B-cell lymphoma patients. The dose expansion study is ongoing, evaluating the safety and efficacy of HMPL-689 in patients with R/R B-cell lymphoma. Acknowledgement 1.

Most features of the procurement procedures and almost all the contract terms and conditions are common to both types of contract. This has provided a rare opportunity internationally to compare the impacts of the alternative procurement methods on contract prices. The paper analyses the prices for the tendered and negotiated bus contracts in NZ's two largest metropolitan areas, Auckland (50 contracts, c.1100 buses) and Wellington (16 contracts, c.400 buses). Key findings are that: (i) for the tendered contracts, significant cost reductions were achieved compared with previous tendering rounds, reflecting the considerable increase in the number of bidders per contract; and (ii) for the negotiated contracts, (gross) costs averaged about 10–15% higher (Auckland) and 30–35% higher (Wellington) than the equivalent tendered costs. These cost disparities reflected the weak position of the regional councils in their contract negotiations with the operators, as a result of the councils not having recourse to tendering as a fallback negotiating position and coming under considerable time pressures to introduce the new services.}

abstract = {Objectives
To discuss the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) criteria for measuring performance in asthma care and to review new strategies to improve the quality of asthma care.
Data Sources
Expert opinion from a roundtable on National Committee for Quality Assurance HEDIS and asthma care, supplemented with a MEDLINE database search to identify articles published between January 1, 1990, and May 31, 2005, with the following keywords in the title: asthma plus HEDIS, pay for performance, incentive programs, reimbursement, or employee education.
Study Selection
Studies and review articles were selected for their relevance to measuring the quality of asthma care using HEDIS and improving care using newer trends, such as employee education and physician incentive programs.
Results
Components of the HEDIS asthma measure have been found to correlate with outcomes, including risk of hospitalization and emergency department visits. However, refinements to the measure may be needed because it may misclassify a portion of patients as having persistent asthma who actually have intermittent asthma according to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria. Physician incentive programs are increasingly being explored as a means of improving the quality of care while managing costs. Under current pay-for-performance programs, rewards are issued to providers who demonstrate high-quality care based on the HEDIS asthma measure.
Conclusions
The HEDIS asthma measure remains the most widely used performance tool for evaluating the quality of asthma care. Reimbursement models based on public reporting and pay for performance are expected to be a strong component of future health care payment systems.}

abstract = {Purpose
New antiviral agents with activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are needed to optimize treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We evaluated the pharmacokinetics of setrobuvir (a non-nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitor) in healthy volunteers (study 1 & 2) and its antiviral efficacy in patients with genotype 1, noncirrhotic treatment-naive CHC (study 3).
Methods
Three studies investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of setrobuvir. First, sequential cohorts of volunteers were randomly assigned to receive single oral doses of setrobuvir 400 to 3000 mg or placebo in a double-blind, ascending dose study. In the second study, volunteers were randomly assigned to receive multiple doses of setrobuvir (400 or 800 mg once daily [QD] or 600 mg twice a day [BID]). In the third study, patients with genotype 1 CHC received setrobuvir (200, 400, or 800 mg) or placebo BID for 3 days.
Findings
After single doses of setrobuvir (400–3000 mg) to volunteers in a fasted state, peak Cmax and AUC0–∞ increased in a less than dose-proportional manner. The mean apparent t½z ranged from 22.0 to 31.3 hours and was not dose related. Cmax and AUC increased significantly (4.3- and 6.3-fold, respectively) in volunteers who received 2000 mg with a high-fat meal versus fasting. After multiple oral doses, steady state was achieved after 7 days of dosing (400 or 800 mg QD and 600 mg BID) and accumulation was dose-independent. Mean day 14 plasma exposure increased in a less than dose-proportional manner in volunteers who received 400 and 800 mg QD, but it was more than dose-proportional in volunteers receiving 600 mg BID. Dose did not affect the mean t½z (range, 24.1–26.6 hours), apparent oral clearance (0.254–0.516 L/h), or apparent volume of distribution (9.60–18.1 L). In patients with CHC, dose-related reductions in HCV RNA concentration were apparent within 24 hours of the start of treatment. Reductions from baseline to the end of treatment (day 3) in patients treated with setrobuvir 200, 400, and 800 mg BID were –2.1, –2.2, and –2.9 log10 IU/mL, respectively (vs ≤0.1 log10 IU/mL with placebo). Reductions in HCV RNA were greater in patients with genotype 1b (range, –2.7 to –3.1 log10 IU/mL) than in patients with genotype 1a (range, –1.3 to –2.7 log10 IU/mL). Setrobuvir was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events.
Implications
The steady state pharmacokinetics of setrobuvir appear to be dose proportional, and setrobuvir produces a mean reduction of 2.9 log10 IU/mL in HCV RNA over 3 days in patients with genotype 1 (a and b) treated with 800 mg BID. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00782353}

abstract = {Motivated by the taxi refusal problem in Bangkok, this paper presents a novel approach of demand-supply matching for taxi services through double auction, where passengers and drivers can offer and ask for a surcharge in addition to a regular meter fare. This system is equivalent to a variable surcharge policy as opposed to the existing fixed surcharge policy. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we examine the design of information content for taxi service auction under two conditions: with and without time-cost. Laboratory experiments with student subjects were conducted to investigate the effect of different levels of information content on bidding strategies and market efficiency. The results show that time-cost has a significant effect on individuals’ bidding strategy and market efficiency. In addition, providing bidders with greater information does not necessarily lead to better efficiency. Second, we compare the performance of the proposed method with that of the fixed surcharge policy. It is found that the variable surcharge policy outperforms the fixed surcharge policy in several aspects. In particular, the variable surcharge policy provides a better opportunity for passengers to get the taxi service and obtains a higher market efficiency at least as good as the fixed surcharge policy.}

Quantifying the economic value of coastal water quality would inform policy decisions that impact the coast and help justify expenditures in water quality improvements. We conducted a non-market valuation of beach recreationalists’ preferences and willingness to pay for water quality and associated attributes at Oahu beaches. Using a discrete choice experiment analyzed by a conditional logit model, results suggest individuals were willing to pay $11.43 per day at the beach to reduce days of bacterial exceedance from 11 to 5 per year, a further $30.72 to reduce it to no bacterial exceedances at all. WTP to move from 15 ft to 30 ft of underwater visibility was $35.71, a further $14.80 to increase from 30 ft to 60 ft. Respondents were also willing to pay $15.33 to improve coral reef cover from 10% to 25%, a further $4.89 to improve to 45% cover. WTP for moving from 9 fish species to 18 species was $7.14, a further $2.47 to increase that to 27 fish species. These environmental improvements can improve Oahu recreationalists’ welfare by $205 million, $550 million, $639 million, $265 million, $274 million, $88 million, $128 million, and $44 million per year, respectively. Welfare gains may justify increased spending in management and restoration of coastal ecosystems.}

A lack of cross-functional integration has been reported in four major international contracting organisations both vertically in the management hierarchy and horizontally along project lifecycles. One of the main aspects previously reported was the low level of management coordination and hence integration of value propositions between business development and bid management functions. This paper examines the matter further. It specifically examines business development (BD) and bid management (BM) in two additional major contractors where the two functions are combined under a single functional department. In the department, the same personnel manage BD and bidding. It poses the research question as to whether this leads to greater levels of coordination and integration. Two dimensions are examined in particular, namely understanding client needs to develop value propositions through BD and developing win-strategies during BM to potentially add value and deliver benefits during execution. The conceptual lens of marketing in construction is used for analysis. There are two main findings. First, the degree of coordination is marginally improved, yet the understanding and effort committed to BD was lower compared to BM. Therefore, the ability to develop win-strategies during BM was compromised by the lower emphasis on BD. Second, it was found that the level of integration between the two functions and with other functions, such as procurement and supply chain management, was low. This compromised the value propositions and delivery of benefits. The outcome is a contractor focus upon survival with sub-optimal strike rates and value propositions.}

In this paper, we show how to calculate and implement the near-optimal reserve price of the wGSP mechanism in realistic settings. Unlike reserve prices in standard single-item auctions, optimal reserve prices in wGSP auctions are discriminatory, different even for advertisers bidding on the same keyword. The optimal reserve price results can be extended to support CPA/CPC/CPM1CPM: cost per mille (impressions), CPA: cost per action, CPC: cost per click.1 hybrid auctions. Our simulations indicate that setting a proper reserve price will transfer some bidder utility (payoff) to auctioneer utility, resulting in higher revenue for the search engine. We describe a practical methodology to implement optimal reserve prices in production systems.}

This study linked microdata on selected bidders from the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) e-procurement portal and the Orbis database. Based on a sample of 933 Spanish companies, the analysis provides empirical support for the cross-border size bias conjecture. The reason for this bias is the predominance of large companies among those that serve both domestic and cross-border procurement markets. This bias disappears when the focus is placed exclusively on the cross-border market. This conclusion enables the identification and description of a herd of springbok firms. These springbok firms are defined as SMEs that eschew the domestic public procurement market to focus on the cross-border market.}

Estimates of the term structure of interest rates depend heavily on the quality of the market data from which it is constructed. Estimated rates can be incorrect due to observation errors and omissions in the data. The usual way to deal with the heteroskedasticity of observation errors is by introducing weights in the fitting procedure. There is currently no consensus in the literature about the choice of such weights. We introduce a non-parametric bootstrap-based method of introducing observation errors drawn from the empirical distribution into the model data, which allows us to perform a comparison test of different weighting schemes without implicitly favoring one of the contesting models – a common design flaw in comparison studies. We use government bonds of several countries to show that realistic observation errors can distort the estimated yield curve. Moreover, we show that using different weights or other modifications of accounting for observation errors in bond price data doesn’t always improve the term structure estimates, and often only worsens the situation. Based on our comparison, we advise to either use equal weights or weights proportional to the inverse duration in practical applications.}

Our results reveal that Mafia infiltration is positively associated with number of submitted bids, awarding rebates and execution cost overruns, whereas it is negatively associated with delivery delays for PWC. The effect of Mafia infiltration on execution cost overruns and the probability of their occurrence is weaker for larger PWC, and the elections of the new municipal councils, after the dissolution of the previous ones, do not significantly influence the performance of PWC. Our findings suggest the presence of collusive schemes among bidding firms within the Mafia network and provide new insights for the implementation of more sound policies to tackle practices associated with Mafia infiltration in public procurement.}

Non-compliance in clinical studies is a significant issue, but causes remain unclear. Utilizing the Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion, this study assessed the psychophysical peripheral cue ‘Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) call frequency’ on compliance.
Methods
71 participants were randomized to once daily (OD), twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID) call schedules over two weeks. Participants completed 30-item cognitive function tests at each call. Compliance was defined as proportion of expected calls within a narrow window (±30 min around scheduled time), and within a relaxed window (−30 min to +4 h). Data were analyzed by ANOVA and pairwise comparisons adjusted by the Bonferroni correction.
Results
There was a relationship between call frequency and compliance. Bonferroni adjusted pairwise comparisons showed significantly higher compliance (p=0.03) for the BID (51.0%) than TID (30.3%) for the narrow window; for the extended window, compliance was higher (p=0.04) with OD (59.5%), than TID (38.4%).
Conclusion
The IVRS psychophysical peripheral cue call frequency supported the ELM as a route to persuasion. The results also support OD strategy for optimal compliance. Models suggest specific indicators to enhance compliance with medication dosing and electronic patient diaries to improve health outcomes and data integrity respectively.}

In fact, after the elimination of their counterparty risk premium they increase the number of competitive quotes both on the bid and ask sides but more pronounced on the ask side.}

Laboratory experiments reveal characteristics of bidder behavior in different regulatory environments. Experimental results provide insight into efficiency and equity tradeoffs inherent in regulatory policy applications with respect to environmental services auctions. While it is possible to reduce the amount of public funds necessary to purchase a given level of environmental services, adverse selection costs and equity considerations may outstrip the benefits gained from threat implementation.}

Although auctions are increasingly used for allocation in PES schemes, the factors that lead to their successful implementation and eventual environmental outcomes are poorly understood in developing countries. We investigated the socio-economic and institutional contexts that led to smallholders' auction winning and eventual compliance using linear mixed-effects models, and post-auction and post-contract surveys. We employed a case study of a conservation contract preceded by a sealed-bid, multiple round, uniform price auction for watershed services from coffee farmers in Lampung, Indonesia. The auction participants presented low education levels, low asset endowments and small plot sizes. The study obtained evidence that farmers with larger plot areas were more likely to win the contracts, suggesting economies of scale. Most farmers considered the auction a fair self-selection mechanism to allocate contracts where allocation was not influenced by power or social rank. Non-compliance was associated with labor availability constraints, short duration of land ownership and existence of previous conservation applications, suggesting lax of capability to invest in applying conservation agriculture. Final bids were however not good predictors of compliance, among other factors, calling into question the potential of auctions to elicit the actual incentive from the farmers. Ensuring that farmers understand the purposes of auctions for effective contract allocation beyond a mere game and identifying farmers that might encounter difficulties fulfilling the contract could increase the likelihood that such a PES scheme would be successful.}

Our results suggest that the capital markets perceive the Volcker Rule as a positive regulatory measure overall. Using our own proxy, we examine market reactions to banks targeted and not targeted by the Volcker Rule and find that the overall positive market response to the Volcker Rule appears to be driven by the larger number of non-targeted, smaller banks. We conclude that the Volcker Rule has a positive effect on smaller banks in that it levels the playing field between large and small banks. Further analyses indicate that banks with higher systemic risk, less liquidity, and worse financial reporting quality are more likely to be negatively impacted by the Volcker Rule. The analyses of these characteristics before and after the announcement of the rule also indicate a positive impact of the Volcker Rule.}

This study examines monetary willingness to accept payments for enrollment in the Forest Bank through a referendum-type survey of forest landowners in Southwestern Virginia. A logistic regression model that predicts the probability of enrollment is estimated using survey data that includes the landowner acceptance or rejection of a given annual payment level, landowner demographic characteristics, and tract characteristics. Findings suggest that landowners are responsive to annual payment bid levels and that financially viable bid levels (relative to local land prices) may generate reasonable probabilities of Forest Bank enrollment. Further, some tract and landowner characteristics are significant in predicting enrollment probability, including the desire to bequeath land to heirs, which suggests that forest-banking arrangements should take the target owners and properties into account—especially recognizing the potential reluctance to accept perpetual arrangements.}

abstract = {In any aquatic system analysis, the modelling water quality parameters are of considerable significance. The traditional modelling methodologies are dependent on datasets that involve large amount of unknown or unspecified input data and generally consist of time-consuming processes. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a flexible mathematical structure that has the capability to identify non-linear and complex relationships between input and output data. There has been a major degradation of the Johor River Basin because of several developmental and human activities. Therefore, setting up of a water quality prediction model for better water resource management is of critical importance and will serve as a powerful tool. The different modelling approaches that have been implemented include: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-ANN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-ANN). However, data obtained from monitoring stations and experiments are possibly polluted by noise signals as a result of random and systematic errors. Due to the presence of noise in the data, it is relatively difficult to make an accurate prediction. Hence, a Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WDT-ANFIS) based augmented wavelet de-noising technique has been recommended that depends on historical data of the water quality parameter. In the domain of interests, the water quality parameters primarily include ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), suspended solid (SS) and pH. In order to evaluate the impacts on the model, three evaluation techniques or assessment processes have been used. The first assessment process is dependent on the partitioning of the neural network connection weights that ascertains the significance of every input parameter in the network. On the other hand, the second and third assessment processes ascertain the most effectual input that has the potential to construct the models using a single and a combination of parameters, respectively. During these processes, two scenarios were introduced: Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. Scenario 1 constructs a prediction model for water quality parameters at every station, while Scenario 2 develops a prediction model on the basis of the value of the same parameter at the previous station (upstream). Both the scenarios are based on the value of the twelve input parameters. The field data from 2009 to 2010 was used to validate WDT-ANFIS. The WDT-ANFIS model exhibited a significant improvement in predicting accuracy for all the water quality parameters and outperformed all the recommended models. Also, the performance of Scenario 2 was observed to be more adequate than Scenario 1, with substantial improvement in the range of 0.5% to 5% for all the water quality parameters at all stations. On validating the recommended model, it was found that the model satisfactorily predicted all the water quality parameters (R2 values equal or bigger than 0.9).}

The results reveal the supply of PES contracts at different prices. Simulations using the auction results and household data show large tradeoffs between achieving cost effectiveness and maximizing participation by poor households. A monitoring survey 21 months after the auction found that most auction winners’ trees had survived, with performance uncorrelated to the farmer's poverty status or bid level. Although aspects of our auction design limit the strength of some of the conclusions we draw from the data, our study shows how pilot auctions can assist decision makers in estimating payment levels for PES contracts. Auction participants stated that the auction provided transparency in contract allocation and that winners felt peer pressure to comply with contracts, which suggest areas for future research regarding the potential advantages of using auctions to allocate PES contracts in developing countries.}

Based on a simple perpetual discounted cash flow model, we argue that the valuation will be lower for a target with higher information uncertainty and acquiring a target with high information uncertainty can potentially create value for an acquirer’s shareholders. The empirical findings lend support to our arguments. Specifically, we observe that a target’s valuation multiple obtained from an acquirer is negatively correlated with the target’s information uncertainty level. An acquirer’s announcement return is negatively correlated with the valuation multiple given to the target but positively correlated with the target’s information uncertainty level. The results are robust against various measurements of valuation multiples and information uncertainty.}

Compared with placebo, there was a statistically and clinically significant increase in mean weekly SBM frequency over the initial 3 weeks of treatment (primary endpoint) with alvimopan 0.5mg BID (+1.71 mean SBMs/week), alvimopan 1mg QD (+1.64) and alvimopan 1mg BID (+2.52); P<0.001 for all comparisons. Increased SBM frequency and additional treatment effects, including improvements in symptoms such as straining, stool consistency, incomplete evacuation, abdominal bloating/discomfort, and decreased appetite, were sustained over 6 weeks. The most frequently reported adverse events were abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea, occurring more frequently in the higher dosage groups. The alvimopan 0.5mg BID regimen demonstrated the best benefit-to-risk profile for managing OBD with alvimopan in this study population, with a side effect profile similar to that of placebo. There was no evidence of opioid analgesia antagonism. Competitive peripheral antagonism of opioids with alvimopan can restore GI function and relieve OBD without compromising analgesia.}

In this paper, an advanced bidding strategy dedicated to optimal dispatch of the WPP in the JERM is proposed. The suggested strategy exploits a novel bi-objective two-stage chance-constrained stochastic model in which various revenue streams, stemming from both day-ahead and real-time stages, are fully accounted for. The first objective of the presented model is to allocate the optimal share of the power assigned to each market floor in the day-ahead stage so as to maximize the WPP’s profit. Then, the formulation considers the confidence level of delivering the contracted reserve power in real-time through an additional competing objective. Meanwhile, the presented method allows us to also illustrate the effect of reserve availability as a probabilistic measure on WPP’s profit. In this regard, the wind speed and system frequency uncertainties are introduced as stochastic inputs in the proposed framework. The obtained revenue streams regarding each market floor as well as the total revenue of the WPP are then evaluated in a Monte Carlo out-of-sample analysis. The ex-post samples contain system frequency data from the Belgian market along with wind speed data representing the wind turbulence intensity level. Outcomes reveal not only the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed model for enhancing WPPs’ revenues, but also the importance of properly considering the uncertain real-time delivery of the contracted reserve power.}

Subjects of our experiment bid consistently with the leading equilibrium notions, but exhibit significant overbidding relative to the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) outcome favored as an equilibrium selection in the literature. The observed bidding behavior is well explained by a model that explicitly accounts for the strategic uncertainty facing a bidder, which suggests strategic uncertainty as a source of the observed departure from the VCG outcome. Meanwhile, the observed bidding behavior in static environment approximates those of dynamic environments for important cases. Our finding thus provides some empirical support for the use of a static game as a valid modeling proxy, but calls into question the prevailing equilibrium selection.}

The effector B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein BCL-2 ovarian killer (BOK) induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) to initiate apoptosis upon inhibition of the proteasome. How BOK mediates MOMP is mechanistically unknown. The NMR structure of the BCL-2 core of human BOK reveals a conserved architecture with an atypical hydrophobic groove that undergoes conformational exchange. Remarkably, the BCL-2 core of BOK spontaneously associates with purified mitochondria to release cytochrome c in MOMP assays. Alanine substitution of a unique glycine in helix α1 stabilizes BOK, as shown by thermal shift and urea denaturation analyses, and significantly inhibits MOMP, liposome permeabilization, and cell death. Activated BID does not activate WT BOK or the stabilized alanine mutant to promote cell death. We propose that BOK-mediated membrane permeabilization is governed in part by its unique metastability of the hydrophobic groove and helix α1 and not through activation by BH3 ligands.}

Based on the survey, we decoupled the inner relationships between the customers’ bidding behavior versus consumption properties through an aggregate thermal state analysis of the customers’ entity. Subsequently, the above data are fitted into an optimization framework with DR modeling to maximize the system’s benefit, optimize the DR control, and find the optimal reward price on saving the system’s generation investment with critical peak reduction. In the DR modeling, we presented a group thermal state model, in which the customers are divided into several groups and respond to the DR signal sequentially to mitigate the behavior-lead cooling-rebound. Besides, we considered the responding convenience of the customers, which is based on their real-time stay-at-home rate and thermal state evaluation during the summer peak. The proposed methodology could strongly support the system’s decision-making and is finally validated within the city of Xi’an, China.}

We control for six critical firm governance characteristics that impact liquidity alongside the market-based controls that are conventionally solely included in the literature. Using a unique sample of 12 Sub Saharan African (SSA) equity markets, namely Kenya, Mauritius, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Ghana, BRVM (Cote d'Ivoire), and then South Africa's ALT-x and Main boards we find evidence that state and foreign venture capitalist involvement in firms enhances liquidity while involvement of foreign partners, entrepreneurial founders, domestic venture capital and inclusion within an extended business or family network has opposite effect. The evidence supports the use of the proportion of daily zero returns measure in preference to other measures in capturing illiquidity. Furthermore we find that liquidity is closely associated with three of six World Bank Governance measures of institutional quality with these being government effectiveness, regulatory quality and rule of law.}

In a sequential auction with the soft close, buyers have a stronger incentive to wait for low reserve prices in the future, and a seller chooses lower reserve prices.}

abstract = {Background
Whether four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are superior to warfarin in Asian patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) remains unclear.
Methods
This nationwide retrospective cohort study was based on data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database from June 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, covering patients with NVAF taking edoxaban (n = 4,577), apixaban (n = 9,952), rivaroxaban (n = 33,022), dabigatran (n = 22,371), and warfarin (n = 19,761). Propensity score weighting was used to balance covariates across study groups. Patients were followed up until occurrence of study outcomes or end date of study.
Results
Edoxaban, apixaban, and rivaroxaban were associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism than warfarin. All DOACs had a lower risk of major bleeding than warfarin. Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding than rivaroxaban and dabigatran, whereas the risk of major bleeding was comparable between edoxaban and apixaban. The reduced risks of thromboembolism/major bleeding for the four DOACs persisted in high-risk subgroups, including those with chronic kidney disease, elderly patients (age ≥ 75 years), secondary stroke prevention, or CHA2DS2-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, and female sex) ≥ 4. A total of 2,924 (64%), 6,359 (64%), 31,108 (94%), and 19,821 (89%) patients received low-dose edoxaban (15-30 mg/d), apixaban (2.5 mg bid), rivaroxaban (10-15 mg/d), and dabigatran (110 mg bid), respectively. The effectiveness/safety outcomes with the four low-dose DOACs compared with warfarin were consistent with the main analysis.
Conclusions
In the largest real-world practice study among Asian patients with NVAF, four DOACs were associated with a comparable or lower risk of thromboembolism, and a lower risk of bleeding than warfarin. There was consistency even among high-risk subgroups and whether standard-or low-dose regimens were compared.}

This paper develops a model of an auction with a buy price in which bidders use the auction's reserve price and buy price to formulate a reference price. The model both explains why a revenue-maximizing seller would want to augment her auction with a buy price and demonstrates that the seller sets a higher reserve price when she can affect the bidders' reference price through the auction's reserve price and buy price than when she can affect the bidders' reference price through the auction's reserve price only. The comparative statics properties of bidding behavior are in sharp contrast to equilibrium behavior in other models where the existence and size of the auction's buy price have no effect on bidding behavior.}

However, in previous studies of spectrum auction, competition can hardly be reflected in the traditional spectrum allocation and the spectrum efficiency is still not high after the allocation. In this paper, we enhance the factor of competition in the auctions, in which bidders need to pay for the competition and the interference to macro cell users (MUs). We consider a communication system with one macro cell and several small cells, thus a licensed radio spectrum is shared by both MUs and small cell users (SUs). A truthful auction algorithm is proposed for spectrum allocation and the spectrum is divided into multiple channels in different time slots, so that SUs can make their choice for bidding under the guidance of history. In order to raise the communication quality, we propose a power control and beamforming algorithm in the heterogeneous network to enhance the system performance. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the small cell network.}

These stressors can combine to create a triple jeopardy effect where more deprived individuals and communities can be disproportionately affected by exposure to air pollution. Despite acknowledgement of this, however, the current statutory Local Air Quality Management regime prescribes that air pollution risks are considered in isolation. This project aimed to develop and test application of a practical method for carrying out air pollution risk assessment in the context of wider health determinants. A number of data components describing health, air pollution and deprivation at small area level were identified for one health board area (comprising two local authority areas) in Wales for 2011-15. These data were then combined within each of the triple jeopardy domains and then overall to assign each small area a prioritisation score to inform air quality management action. Areas were then ranked in order with a view to identifying priority areas (and clusters) for integrated air quality management and public health intervention. Local environmental and public health stakeholders were involved throughout the process and asked to provide feedback on the approach, particularly in relation to applying it in practice and evaluating its merit in terms of helping achieve local and national wellbeing policy goals. The piloted tool - called Health and Air Pollution Risk Assessment/Area Prioritisation (HAP-RAP) - offered a contemporary public health-driven approach to risk assessment intended to complement existing [narrow focus] prescribed air quality management approaches. It highlighted areas for action that were different in location, scale and size from local air quality management areas declared through existing processes. Further, stakeholder comments suggested the approach can help support more collaborative, effective and efficient ways of working, facilitate stronger policy and practice integration and achieve greater population health impact.}

In a world where there are increasing numbers of jurisdictions moving to competitive tendering for their land based public transport, there is an increased incidence of a change in operator when the term of the contract comes to an end. In many jurisdictions, the anecdotal evidence on the disruption caused by this change in operator is growing. Is there a danger that Government decides to stay with a bad outcome because previous experience with transition was bad? Or conversely, might Government opt for a transition simply on the basis of the bid offer price without taking account of the transaction (especially disruption) costs involved for government, operator and the travelling public? We investigate this issue using a stated choice experiment in which members of evaluation committees are presented with a series of alternative operator bids that include, ex ante, a measure of the transition costs identified as a proportion of the lowest offer for the contract, and two proxy descriptors of operator reputation. The outcome of the experiment is modelled as a mixed logit choice model to identify the role that the transition costs play in influencing the preferences of evaluation committee members, providing evidence for the first time on the extent to which the often unreported role of such transition costs, perceived or real, appear to play in the minds of competitive tender evaluation.}

The California cap and trade scheme imposes limits on allowance ownership, uses a tiered price containment reserve sale, and settles allowance auctions based on the lowest accepted bid. We examine the effects of these features on market liquidity, efficiency, and price variability. We find that tight holding limits substantially reduce banking, which, in turn reduces market liquidity. This impairs the ability of traders to smooth prices over time, resulting in lower efficiency and higher price variability. The price containment reserve, while increasing the supply of allowances available to traders, does not appear to mitigate the effects of tight holding limits on market outcomes. As a result, the imposition of holding limits in the allowance market may have the consequence of increasing the likelihood of the market manipulation that they were intended to prevent. Finally, we find that the choice between lowest accepted bid and highest rejected bid for the allowance auction pricing rule does not have a significant effect on market outcomes.}

Primary objectives were to evaluate tolerability, compliance, and perception of ranolazine effectiveness for chronic stable angina in a routine clinical setting. The secondary objective was safety evaluation.
Methods
Prospective, multi-centre, observational, study with a 6-month follow-up and study visits at baseline, 3- and 6months in patients with chronic stable angina. Ranolazine was administered according to the summary of product characteristics and investigator discretion. Data was collected on patient and disease characteristics, concomitant therapy, angina frequency and severity, quality of life (QoL), perception of effectiveness, compliance, and adverse events.
Results
Between July 2010 and July 2012, 189 patients were enrolled at 20 centres. Ranolazine decreased the proportion of patients experiencing angina attacks from 88.4% at baseline to 26.5% at 6months (p<0.001). Heart rate and blood pressure were not appreciably affected. The proportion of patients without symptoms on normal exertion (Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading class I) increased from 22.3% to 75.3% (p<0.001); patients reporting limitations in daily activities decreased from 80.4% to 35.5%. (p<0.001). Patient- and physician-assessed QoL improved (both p<0.001). Therapeutic efficacy was rated “good” or “very good” in 67.7% of cases by physicians, and by 63.5% of the patients. Physicians rated compliance “good” or “very good” in 73.5% of cases. Adverse events were consistent with previous reports, and consisted of 40 events in 24 patients; 12 were serious.
Conclusions
Ranolazine was associated with decreased angina frequency and severity, and improvements in QoL. The benefits provided by ranolazine in controlled clinical trials are maintained in the clinical setting.}

We compared the developmental competence, quality and gene expression of transgenic embryos produced by Hand-made cloning from buffalo fetal fibroblasts (BFFs) containing human insulin gene, with non-transgenic embryos produced from BFFs (Controls). The expression vector (pAcISUBC), constructed by inserting human insulin gene between DNA fragments containing mammary gland-specific buffalo β-lactoglobulin (buBLG) promoter and terminator buBLG 3′UTR regions into pAcGFP-N1 vector, was used for obtaining the 11 kb insert for transfection of BFFs by nucleofection. Presence of the transgene in embryos was confirmed by examining GFP expression by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. The blastocyst rate was lower (P < 0.05) for transgenic embryos than for controls (35.7 ± 1.8% vs 48.7 ± 2.4%). The apoptotic index was higher (P < 0.05) for transgenic than for control blastocysts which, in turn, was higher (P < 0.05) than for IVF counterparts (6.9 ± 0.9, 3.8 ± 0.5 and 1.8 ± 0.3, respectively). The total cell number was similar for transgenic and non-transgenic blastocysts (143.2 ± 17.0 and 137.2 ± 7.6, respectively). The expression level of pro-apoptotic genes BAX and BID but not that of CASP3 and CASP9, and cell cycle check point control-related gene P53 was higher (P < 0.05), and that of development- (IGF-1R and G6PD) and pluripotency-related gene NANOG was lower (P < 0.05) in transgenic than in control embryos.

The expression level of BAX, BID, CASP9, P53, DNMT1 and DNMT3a was higher (P < 0.05) and that of OCT4, NANOG IGF-1R and G6PD was lower (P < 0.05) in cloned transgenic than in IVF blastocysts whereas, that of CASP3 and HDAC1 was similar between the two groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that transgenic embryos produced by SCNT have lower developmental competence and quality, and altered gene expression compared to non-transgenic embryos.}

abstract = {Multiattribute reverse auction has become prevalent for the procurement of goods and services in recent days. In such an auction, a group of potential suppliers bid to win the contract that has been defined in multiple attributes by the buyer for providing goods or services. A corresponding winner determination problem provides important decisions for the buyer to select its best supplier. Considering the buyer with risk aversion behavior and suppliers with positive and negative attributes described by a combination of crisp data, interval numbers and linguistic variables in a multiattribute reverse auction setting, we incorporate the prospect theory (PT) into the “benefits, opportunities, costs and risks” (BOCR) framework to propose a novel PT-BOCR solution method. The effectiveness and distinct advantage of our method on dealing with the buyer׳s risk averse attitude are demonstrated in comparison with other known methods. Computational results indicate that the PT-BOCR method is robust with respect to the variance of suppliers׳ attributes and the level of reference points. An interesting result reveals that when suppliers׳ attributes vary a lot, the degree of risk aversion increases or decreases depending on the reference point is low or high. The PT-BOCR method could be a useful tool for risk aversion buyers to avoid losses and for suppliers to win the bids by improving their attributes.}

Abstract 176 This icon denotes a clinically relevant abstract
Background:
Ruxolitinib (RUX) has demonstrated clinical benefit for patients with myelofibrosis (MF) with or without the JAK2V617F mutation at starting doses of 15 or 20 mg PO BID by alleviating symptoms, improving quality of life measures, reducing spleen volume and exhibiting an apparent increase in overall survival in the phase III placebo (PBO)-controlled COMFORT-I study. Reversible declines in platelet count and hemoglobin (Hgb) can occur with ruxolitinib but are rarely treatment-limiting. Patients with MF who have low platelet counts represent an important subset of MF patients; given the potential risk of bleeding complications, a dosing strategy for such patients is needed. We assessed an alternative strategy using lower starting doses of ruxolitinib with subsequent dose escalation in patients with MF who have platelet counts of 50–100 × 109/L (Study INCB018424-258; NCT01348490).
Methods:
RUX dosing started at 5 mg BID. With adequate platelet count, doses could increase by 5 mg once daily every 4 weeks to 10 mg BID. Further increases required evidence of suboptimal efficacy. Assessments include measurement of MF symptoms (MF Symptom Assessment Form v2.0 Total Symptom Score [TSS]); Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC); EORTC QLQ-C30, measurement of spleen volume by MRI, and safety/tolerability.
Results:
A total of 50 patients have enrolled, with data available for 41 patients. Nineteen have completed 24 weeks of treatment; >70% of these patients attained a final dose of ≥10 mg BID of RUX. Treatment was generally well tolerated in this study population with no withdrawals for thrombocytopenia or bleeding events. Based on analysis of adverse events, no new safety signals were observed in this population of MF patients with low platelet counts. Data for efficacy parameters, including spleen volume reduction, TSS reduction, and improvement in EORTC-QLQ-C30 subscales and PGIC were consistent with RUX treatment in the COMFORT-I study, and demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy compared with the COMFORT-I PBO arm (Table).RUX Study 258 N=41RUX COMFORT-I N=155PBO COMFORT-I N=154Mean Baseline platelet count, x109/L73321280Mean Baseline Hgb in patients with no transfusions, g/L108123115Week 12/Week 24Week 12/Week 24Week 12/Week 24Mean total daily dose, mg15.1/19.130.4/29.60Mean change from Baseline platelet count, x109/L−1.0/−5.3−130/−159−9.1/−11.2Mean change from Baseline Hgb, g/L−1.8/−0.2−18/−11+1.3/+1.9Week 24Week 24Week 24≥50% reduction in TSS, % of patients36465.3≥35% reduction in spleen volume, % of patients33420.7“Much” or “Very much improved” on PGIC, % of patients596711Mean change from Baseline on EORTC QLQ-C30 Fatigue Subscale*–23.4–14.81.8Mean change from Baseline on EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health/Quality of Life†16.212.3–3.4*Negative changes indicate improvement.†Positive changes indicate improvement. Of 19 patients with platelet count data through Week 24, 5 showed increased platelet count over the duration of the study (range of increase: 20 to 95 x109/L); all 5 patients had optimized dosing to ≥10 mg BID. Compared with the 14 patients showing smaller increases or modest decreases in platelet count, these 5 patients were younger (mean age: 63 years vs. 71 years), had been diagnosed with MF more recently (2.2 years vs. 5.2 years) and had lower DIPSS scores (60% Intermediate-1; 20% Intermediate-2; 20% High vs. 0% Intermediate-1; 79% Intermediate-2; 21% High). Four patients (9.8%) reported adverse events of bleeding (excluding events related to bruising) of any grade (all events were Grade 1 except one Grade 2 hematochezia), consistent with previously reported hemorrhage frequency in the COMFORT-I study (16.8%, RUX; 12.6%, PBO).
Conclusions:
These preliminary findings suggest that a dosing strategy of a low starting dose of RUX with escalation to 10 mg BID may be appropriate in MF patients who have low platelet counts. Most patients were able to titrate to a dose of ≥10 mg BID of RUX, a dose showing efficacy for both spleen volume and patient-reported outcomes generally consistent with previously reported data from Phase III trials. An increase in platelet counts was observed in approximately one-fourth of patients who completed 24 weeks of RUX treatment. Escalation to, and subsequent maintenance of, a 10 mg BID dose of RUX also preserves both Hgb and platelet count which may be beneficial for MF patients with anemia or thrombocytopenia.

This inpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject and between-groups pilot study investigated the dose-dependent effects of ibudilast, a glial cell modulator, on oxycodone-induced analgesia. Opioid-dependent volunteers were maintained on morphine (30mg, PO, QID) for two weeks and received placebo ibudilast (0mg, PO, BID) during the 1st week (days 1–7). On day 8, participants (N=10/group) were randomized to receive ibudilast (20 or 40mg, PO, BID) or placebo for the remainder of the study. On days 4 (week 1) and 11 (week 2), the analgesic, subjective, and physiological effects of oxycodone (0, 25, 50mg/70kg, PO) were determined. Analgesia was measured using the cold pressor test; participants immersed their hand in cold water (4°C) and pain threshold and pain tolerability were recorded. Oxycodone decreased pain threshold and tolerability in all groups during week 1. During week 2, the placebo group exhibited a blunted analgesic response to oxycodone for pain threshold and subjective pain ratings, whereas the 40mg BID ibudilast group exhibited greater analgesia as measured by subjective pain ratings (p≤0.05). Oxycodone also increased subjective drug effect ratings associated with abuse liability in all groups during week 1 (p≤0.05); ibudilast did not consistently affect these ratings. These findings suggest that ibudilast may enhance opioid-induced analgesia. Investigating higher ibudilast doses may establish the utility of pharmacological modulation of glial activity to maximize the clinical use of opioids.}

To compare quality of life (QOL) and activity measures between healthy control cats and cats with subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and to evaluate the effect of oral atenolol therapy on QOL, activity, and circulating biomarkers in cats with subclinical HCM.
Animals
Thirty-two client-owned cats with subclinical HCM and 27 healthy control cats.
Methods
Owner responses to a QOL questionnaire, circulating cardiac biomarker concentrations, and accelerometer-based activity measures were compared prospectively in cats with and without HCM, and in cats with HCM before and after treatment with oral atenolol (6.25 mg/cat q 12 h) for 6 months.
Results
Owner-assessed activity of daily living score was lower in cats with HCM than in cats in controls (p=0.0420). No differences were identified between control cats and cats with HCM for any activity variable. Compared with placebo, treatment with atenolol was associated with a lower baseline-adjusted mean ± SD heart rate (157 ± 30 vs. 195 ± 20 bpm; p=0.0001) and rate-pressure product (22,446 ± 6,237 vs. 26,615 ± 4,623 mmHg/min; p=0.0146). A treatment effect of atenolol on QOL or activity was not demonstrated.
Conclusions
This study failed to identify an effect of subclinical HCM on owner-assessed QOL or activity or a treatment effect of atenolol on these variables at the dosage evaluated. These findings do not support a treatment benefit of atenolol for the goal of symptom reduction in cats with subclinical HCM.}

abstract = {Aim
Basal insulin dose (BID) determination is the key to successful flexible insulin therapy (FIT). As our hypothesis was that BID changes over time, the primary objective of the present study was to determine the changes in BID 1year after a therapeutic educational programme on FIT.
Methods
This single-centre retrospective study recruited the first 40 type 1 adult diabetic patients undergoing an educational FIT programme, which was conducted over a 4-day hospital stay and included a carbohydrate-fasting test.
Results
Patients’ BIDs decreased between Day 0 and Day 4 after the programme (0.31±0.11IU/kg/day vs 0.27±0.09IU/kg/day; P<0.0001), and was increased at 1year (0.29±0.09IU/kg/day; P=0.004). There was no significant variation in prandial insulin requirements. A tendency toward a reduction in HbA1c was observed at 1year (8.3±1.4% vs 8.1±1.6%; P=0.075), with a decrease by more than 0.5% in 37.5% of patients. Body weight increased at 1year (66.9±10.4kg vs 68.1±10.7kg; P=0.003), and the gain was greater than 5% in 7.5% of patients. Frequency of mild hypoglycaemia either remained stable (40%) or decreased (30%). Only nine patients (baseline HbA1c 8.03±1.7%, baseline BID 0.27±0.09IU/kg/day) had BID increases more than 20%, with no changes in prandial insulin requirements and no distinctive phenotype. Baseline HbA1c, and BID have an impact on the BID at 1year of approximately 0.3IU/kg/day in most patients.
Conclusion
The stability of BID over 1year, with values close to 0.3IU/kg/day associated with a trend towards improvement in HbA1c, reduction in the frequency of mild hypoglycaemic episodes and absence of major weight gain, supports the relevance of FIT educational training.
Résumé
Contexte
La détermination des doses d’insuline basale (DIB) est un élément clé du succès d’une approche d’insulinothérapie fonctionnelle (IF). Notre hypothèse était que les DIB dérivent dans le temps. Notre objectif était de déterminer l’évolution des DIB un an après éducation thérapeutique à l’IF.
Méthodes
Étude rétrospective monocentrique réalisée chez les 40 premiers patients diabétiques de type 1 adultes qui avaient bénéficié d’un programme d’éducation à l’IF, réalisé au cours d’une hospitalisation de quatre jours avec épreuve de jeûne glucidique.
Résultats
Les DIB ont diminué entre j0 et j4 après stage (0,31±0,11 vs 0,27±0,09UI/kg par jour, P<0,0001) puis augmenté à un an (0,29±0,09UI/kg par jour, P=0,004). Il n’y avait pas de variation des besoins en insuline prandiale. Une tendance à une diminution de l’HbA1c a été observée à un an (8,3±1,4 vs 8,1±1,6 %, P=0,075), avec une réduction de plus de 0,5 % chez 37,5 % des patients. Le poids a augmenté (66,9±10,4 vs 68,1±10,7kg, P=0,003), de plus de 5 % chez 7,5 % des patients. La fréquence d’hypoglycémies modérées est restée stable (40 %) ou a diminué (30 %). Seuls neuf patients (HbA1c initiale 8,03±1,7 %, DIB 0,27±0,09UI/kg par jour) ont augmenté leur DIB de plus de 20 %, sans variation des besoins en insuline prandiale, ni phénotype distinct. L’HbA1c et la DIB initiales influencent l’évolution de la DIB à un an, convergeant vers 0,3UI/kg par jour chez la majorité des patients.
Conclusion
La stabilité de la dose d’insuline basale sur un an, voisine de 0,3UI/kg par jour, avec une tendance à l’amélioration de l’HbA1c, une réduction de la fréquence des hypoglycémies modérées et une absence de gain pondéral majeur, tend à valider l’intérêt d’une éducation thérapeutique à l’IF.}

This contract form, it has been argued, gives weak incentives for operators to deliver the desired quality level. Therefore many procuring public transport authorities amend contracts with quality incentives. This paper examines how such quality incentives influence quality outcomes with focus on cancelled departures and delays. The main findings are that the introduction of quality incentives are correlated with both increases and decreases of measured quality outcomes. We hypothesise that the results are driven by underlying cost changes for achieving desired quality objectives that exceed the possible revenues from the incentives. In interviews with the Stockholm public transport authority (SL) and some operators, two central observations surface. The first is that there are causes for quality failures that are not solely the responsibility of operators and that these are therefore not fully reached by the incentives, and the second is that the operators believe that they have exhausted what they can do under the current contracts.}

The observed voting premium in the main treatment is high and can only be accounted for if some subjects either overestimate their pivotality or do not pay attention to pivotality at all. A model of instrumental voting, which assumes that individuals are overconfident and that they overestimate the errors of others, is consistent with results from treatments that make the issue of pivotality salient to experimental subjects.}

Here we studied association between sequence and expression variations in apoptotic pathway genes and risk of oral cancer and precancer. Ninety nine tag SNPs in 23 genes, involved in mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, were genotyped in 525 cancer and 253 leukoplakia patients and 538 healthy controls using Illumina Golden Gate assay. Six SNPs (rs1473418 at BCL2; rs1950252 at BCL2L2; rs8190315 at BID; rs511044 at CASP1; rs2227310 at CASP7 and rs13010627 at CASP10) significantly modified risk of oral cancer but SNPs only at BCL2, CASP1and CASP10 modulated risk of leukoplakia. Combination of SNPs showed a steep increase in risk of cancer with increase in “effective” number of risk alleles. In silico analysis of published data set and our unpublished RNAseq data suggest that change in expression of BID and CASP7 may have affected risk of cancer. In conclusion, three SNPs, rs1473418 in BCL2, rs1950252 in BCL2L2 and rs511044 in CASP1, are being implicated for the first time in oral cancer. Since SNPs at BCL2, CASP1 and CASP10 modulated risk of both leukoplakia and cancer, so, they should be studied in more details for possible biomarkers in transition of leukoplakia to cancer. This study also implies importance of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway gene (such as BCL2) in progression of leukoplakia to oral cancer.}

We show that market makers closer to the firm's headquarters spend more time at the inside bid and ask quotes, initiate larger changes in the quotes, and account for greater information share when compared to non-local market makers. Examining a sample of relocating firms, we also find that market makers moving farther away from the firm after relocation experience a reduction in their contributions to price discovery. Our results suggest that some (local) market makers possess superior information relative to other (non-local) market makers and they trade strategically on this information, a finding that challenges the traditional assumptions in market microstructure theory.}

The default risk premium accounts for 40% of CDS spreads. Our results indicate that the bid-ask spread and noise measures are important factors in explaining the illiquidity of both CDS spreads and risk premia. The Fitch liquidity score and the number of contributors are poor measures of liquidity.}

abstract = {Background
Pharmacodynamic (PD) subanalyses of clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis demonstrated the efficacy of apremilast correlated with reductions in cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
Objective
This PD subanalysis of a phase IV, randomized, controlled trial (UNVEIL) in systemic-naive patients with moderate plaque psoriasis (psoriasis-involved body surface area [BSA] 5%–10%; static Physician’s Global Assessment [sPGA] = 3) evaluated the relationship between efficacy and changes in inflammatory biomarkers with apremilast 30 mg twice daily (BID) versus placebo.
Methods
Patients were randomized (2:1) to apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo for 16 weeks. Blood samples were analyzed for interleukins (IL)-17A, −17F, -22, and -23; cardiometabolic biomarkers (leptin; adiponectin; apolipoproteins A–I, A-II, B, and E); and the number of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, regulatory T cells, and total T cells at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Correlations were examined between percentage change in biomarkers and efficacy (based on PGAxBSA).
Results
Of 221 randomized patients, 38 were included in PD analyses (placebo, n = 12; apremilast, n = 26). Median percentage reductions in plasma cytokine levels were significantly greater with apremilast versus placebo for IL-17A (P < 0.05), IL -17F (P < 0.001), and IL-22 (P < 0.01) at Week 4 and IL-22 (P < 0.05) at Week 16. At Week 16, in patients receiving apremilast, improvement in PGAxBSA significantly correlated with change in IL-17A (r = 0.45, P = 0.04). Adipokines, apolipoproteins, and T-cell population levels were largely unchanged.
Conclusion
Clinical improvements in psoriasis correlated with apremilast-mediated decreases in IL-17A without significantly affecting systemic IL-23 levels, adipokines, or Th17 and regulatory T-cell numbers.}

Although the establishment of DZs is regarded to boost regional economic growth, whether or not it really improves industrial land use efficiency (ILUE) has not been adequately examined. Using firm-level data collected from Hangzhou, a typical megacity in China, geographically weighted regression is first applied to examine the spatially nonstationary associations between ILUE and potential determinants, and variance partitioning analysis is further used to compare the relative importance of the ILUE determinants. Then, hypothesis testing and Heckman selection model are utilized to quantify the impact of different types of DZs on ILUE. Results show, the capital intensity and employee density are major determinants of ILUE, and similar as other policy, agglomeration, location and firm heterogeneity factors, the association between them and ILUE is spatially nonstationary. Moreover, firms in high-tech industry development zones (HIDZs) have significantly higher ILUE, but no matter what the administrative level and development stage of economic and technological development zones (ETDZs) are, the firms in them own significantly lower ILUE. Besides, more intensive firm clusters and preferential policies will not help further improve ILUE for the in-zone firms, and the intensive land use related indicators are insignificant in the selection procedure. In general, DZs influence firm-level ILUE through selection effect, policy effect, cluster effect and location effect. HIDZs successfully promote ILUE of in-zone firms, but ETDZs fail to do so because of the abuse of preferential policy and the weak enforcement of intensive industrial land use policies. Implications are formulated for policy makers to improve ILUE within the context of high-quality development.}

abstract = {Background
Until recently, warfarin was the only oral anticoagulant available in the United States. Its narrow therapeutic index, interpatient variability in dose response, and drug and food interactions make it difficult to use. Dabigatran etexilate (DE) is a new oral direct thrombin inhibitor that was approved in the US and in Canada for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), as well as in Europe and Canada for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE).
Objective
To discuss the role of DE for the prevention and treatment of VTE, as well as for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF.
Methods
Peer-reviewed clinical trials, review articles, and treatment guidelines were identified from MEDLINE and the Current Contents database (both 1966–February 15, 2012) using the search terms dabigatran, VTE, Afib, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacoeconomics, and cost-effectiveness. Citations from available articles were also reviewed for additional references.
Results
For VTE prophylaxis, DE 150 or 220 mg orally daily has demonstrated either superiority or noninferiority to subcutaneous enoxaparin once daily in most studies. However, one study failed to demonstrate noninferiority to subcutaneous enoxaparin dosed BID in the composite end point of VTE, and all-cause mortality. For VTE treatment, DE 150 mg BID orally was shown to be noninferior to warfarin in preventing recurrent events. For AF, DE 150 mg BID orally is superior to warfarin in the prevention of thromboembolism, whereas 110 mg BID is noninferior to warfarin. Pharmacoeconomic analyses performed in the United Kingdom and Ireland found that DE can be cost-saving compared with enoxaparin in the prevention of VTE. Adverse effects of DE reported in clinical studies include dyspepsia (12%–13%) and bleeding (minor bleeding: 6%–22%).
Conclusions
DE exhibited a safety profile and efficacy comparable to enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis; comparable safety profile and efficacy to warfarin for VTE treatment; and superiority (150 mg BID orally) in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism compared with warfarin in patients with AF. The relative ease of oral administration, no need for routine monitoring, and lack of significant drug interactions, may favor use of DE over other anticoagulants. However, there is no antidote for DE currently available.}

We examine several potential explanations related to omitted variable bias and endogeneity and the result remains.

The study consisted of an experimental set-up via two questionnaires which differed in the existence of competition in the bidding scenario. The findings showed that bidding decision makers changed their evaluation of the cost estimate due to the introduction of competition but kept their evaluations of the profit margin and price bids constant. Furthermore, the participants listed the relevant sources of uncertainty that influenced their decision-making process. This research contributes to the literature in two ways. First, our findings showed that predictions from current theory regarding decision-making of cost estimation and pricing are not confirmed when competitively bidding for PSS. Second, we show uncertainty sources that influenced the decision makers and identified p the importance of internal processes of the PSS provider and environmental uncertainty.}

In this paper, we model the strategic behavior of the selfish peers by leveraging the rich theory of mechanism design using the concept of economic auctions. By considering the bandwidth of services as the commodity, we design a revenue-maximizing auction mechanism. The sellers are either the origin servers or the peers who forward the digital multimedia content to their downstream peers. For each seller, the corresponding downstream peers play the role of buyers who are referred to as bidders. Each bidder submits a sealed bid to the corresponding seller. The highest bidder wins and pays its bid for the service. Also, we derive analytical closed-form expressions for upper bounds relevant to the performance metrics. The experimental validation proves the scalability and the efficiency of the proposed mechanism.}

We compared counterfactual benchmark outcomes to the actual dispatches to determine the production efficiency. Moreover, Iran's power market is a discriminatory, day-ahead auction; therefore, we considered the market design in the competitive benchmark. We found that the production was inefficient in both 2006 and 2012. More importantly, the production in the market is becoming increasingly inefficient over time due to exercising market power and distortion of the market's production by strategic firms. Not only were strategic firms distorting the market's production, but they were also learning to exercise more non-competitive behavior because these firms distorted the production in 2012 eight times more than they did in 2006.}

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a sensory experience and educational message on consumer value for fluid milk in different containers: translucent high-density polyethylene (HDPE), white-pigmented HDPE (light-block), and paperboard. We carried out 11 auction sessions (n = 100). Sessions included an explanation of the experiment process; a survey about demographics and milk purchasing and consumption behaviors; a sensory evaluation; an educational message; and 3 rounds of nth price auctions. Consumers were blindly served 2 pairs of milk samples—2% milk from paperboard and translucent HDPE, and skim milk from paperboard and translucent HDPE—and asked to indicate their preference and level of acceptability for each, using a 7-point hedonic scale. Consumers were asked to ascribe a monetary value to each sample. Consumers were also asked to taste and assess a value for 2% and skim milk from light-block HDPE. All milk samples were evaluated simultaneously by a panel of 9 judges who were trained to evaluate milk quality attributes on a 15 cm unstructured line scale. All milk was from the same industry source, processed and stored on the same timeline for each session. Results from the consumer panel on acceptability, trained panel descriptive analysis and consumer bids were analyzed using multi-factor ANOVA. Subjecting responses to pre- and post-surveys to k means cluster analysis revealed 4 bidding populations in each round. Trained panelists detected higher levels of light-oxidized off-flavor in skim milk from translucent HDPE (5.8 cm) than from light-block HDPE (2.42 cm) and in 2% milk from translucent HDPE (5.1 cm) than from paperboard (0.32 cm). Although 84% of participants regularly purchased milk in plastic containers, consumers' acceptability scores for milk of the same fat content but from different packaging were not different. However, consumers gave higher acceptability scores to 2% milk from paperboard (5.2/7.0) than skim milk from paperboard (4.7/7.0). We found no differences in consumer value (US$) for 2% or skim milk in paperboard or translucent HDPE. However, after consumers received an educational message and tasted “Certified Fresh Taste” samples, they were willing to pay more for 2% milk in paperboard ($0.31 more) or HDPE ($0.38 more) packaging with a “Certified Fresh Taste” seal and for skim milk in paperboard ($0.15 more) or HDPE ($0.21 more) packaging with a “Certified Fresh Taste” seal than for milk in packaging without such labeling. Although consumers could not detect a difference in the milk from different packages, they indicated that they would pay more for a “Certified Fresh Taste” seal after hearing about the effects of light on milk in different packaging, demonstrating the importance to consumers of external cues about freshness.}

Furthermore, when SCT firms announce relatively large acquisitions, bidder returns and the percent change in the combined values of bidders and targets are lower than the corresponding returns for other firms. Finally, when SCT firms make large acquisitions, they are significantly more likely to suffer a loss in their GPWI ranking as compared with other SCT firms. Overall, the results are consistent with the conclusion that the M&A policies of firms are influenced by a culture of trust between employees and management.}

However, site assessment is costly, has high skill demand, and is time-consuming. We assess the marginal gain associated with including site-scale indicators in metrics typically used by agri-environmental stewardship schemes and payments for ecosystem services. We developed 18 landscape-scale and 14 site-scale indicators to prioritise sites for on-ground works in a real-world conservation auction in South Australia. We used the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to weight them and multi-attribute utility theory to combine them in quantifying site priority. Bid benefit was calculated as the product of impact of the proposed works and the site priority. Cost-utility analysis was used to rank and select bids with benefits calculated using: i) landscape-scale indicators, and; ii) both landscape- and site-scale indicators. We found that the inclusion of site-scale indicators has limited influence on the ranking and selection of bids for investment when cost of investment is included in the decision-making process. We suggest that, depending on the nature of costs and benefits, and if landholder engagement, information sharing, and trust-building can be achieved in more efficient ways, site assessment may not be necessary. Thereby a significant barrier to the adoption of cost-effective agri-environment schemes and payments for ecosystem services may be eliminated.}

abstract = {Background
It is increasingly important for faculty to teach deliberately and provide timely, detailed, and formative feedback on surgical trainee performance. We initiated a multicenter study to improve resident evaluative processes and enhance teaching and learning behaviors while engaging residents in their education.
Study Design
Faculty from 7 US postgraduate training programs rated resident operative performances using the perioperative briefing, intraoperative teaching, debriefing model, and rated patient visits/academic performances using the entrustable professional activities model via a web-based platform. Data were centrally analyzed and iterative changes made based on participant feedback, individual preferences, and database refinements, with trends addressed using the Plan, Do, Check, Act improvement methodology.
Results
Participants (92 surgeons, 150 residents) submitted 3,880 assessments during July 2014 through September 2017. Evidence of preoperative briefings improved from 33.9% ± 2.5% to 95.5% ± 1.5% between April and September 2014 compared with April and September 2017 (p < 0.001). Postoperative debriefings improved from 10.6% ± 2.7% to 90.2% ± 2.5% (p < 0.001) for the same period. Meaningful self-reflection by residents improved from 28.6% to 67.4% (p < 0.001). The number of assessments received per resident during a 6-month period increased from 6.4 ± 6.2 to 13.4 ± 10.1 (p < 0.003). Surgeon-entered assessments increased from 364 initially to 685 in the final period, and the number of resident assessments increased from 308 to 445. We showed a 4-fold increase in resident observed activities being rated.
Conclusions
By adopting recognized educational models with repeated Plan, Do, Check, Act cycles, we increased the quality of preoperative learning objectives, showed more frequent, detailed, and timely assessments of resident performance, and demonstrated more effective self-reflection by residents. We monitored trends, identified opportunities for improvement and successfully sustained those improvements over time, applying a team-based approach.}

abstract = {We examine a supply chain in which a manufacturer participates in a sealed-bid lowest price procurement auction through a distributor. This form of supply chain is common when a manufacturer is active in an overseas market without establishing a local subsidiary. To gain a strategic advantage in the division of profit, the manufacturer and distributor may intentionally conceal information about the underlying cost distribution of the competition. In this environment of information asymmetry, we determine the equilibrium mark-up, the ex-ante expected mark-up and expected profit of the manufacturer and the equilibrium bid of the distributor. In unilateral communication, we demonstrate the informed agent’s advantage resulting to higher mark-up. Under information sharing, we show that profit is equally shared among the supply chain partners and we explicitly derive the mark-up when the underlying cost distribution is uniform in [0,1]. The model and findings are illustrated by a numerical example.}

abstract = {The theory of procurement auctions traditionally assumes that the offered quantity and quality is fixed prior to source selection. Multi-attribute reverse auctions allow negotiation over price and qualitative attributes such as color, weight, or delivery time. They promise higher market efficiency through a more effective information exchange of buyer’s preferences and supplier’s offerings. This paper focuses on a number of winner determination problems in multi-attribute auctions. Previous work assumes that multi-attribute bids are described as attribute value pairs and that the entire demand is purchased from a single supplier. Our contribution is twofold: First, we will analyze the winner determination problem in case of multiple sourcing. Second, we will extend the concept of multi-attribute auctions to allow for configurable offers. Configurable offers enable suppliers to specify multiple values and price markups for each attribute. In addition, suppliers can define configuration and discount rules in form of propositional logic statements. These extensions provide suppliers with more flexibility in the specification of their bids and allow for an efficient information exchange among market participants. We will present MIP formulations for the resulting allocation problems and an implementation.}

Purpose: Sleep quality was considered a priority concern facing pregnant women. Conventional wisdom argues that good sleep quality benefits pregnant women and their fetuses. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a specific exercise program on the　sleep quality in pregnant women. Methods: Searches were executed in seven databases since their inceptions until February 28, 2019, for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of an exercise program on the sleep quality and insomnia in pregnant women. A random-effects model was applied for meta-analysis, and odds ratio, mean differences (MDs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are shown as parts of outcomes. Results: Seven studies were included for meta-analysis. Compared with their not-exercising counterparts, analyses showed that regularly exercising women had significantly enhanced sleep quality, with an odds ratio of 6.21 (95% CI, 2.02–19.11;p = .001; I2 = 80.2%), with a standardized MD of −0.93 (95% CI, −1.19 to −0.67; p < .001; I2 = 30.0%). However, exercising women showed no significant insomnia improvement, with an standardized MD of −2.85 (95% CI, −7.67 to 1.98; p = .250; I2 = 97.0%), relative to their not-exercising counterparts. Conclusion: This research indicated that exercise has a positive impact on the sleep quality of pregnant women. Despite the aforementioned positive impact on sleep quality, the present study did not find evidence to support that exercise may also improve insomnia for pregnant women.}

abstract = {The lack of school construction professionals in Taiwan typically leads to poor construction scheduling and quality. Professional construction management (PCM) is thus introduced to minimize defects in school construction projects. However, satisfaction with PCM services remains unknown because there is no evaluation for such services. This study presents a satisfaction evaluation model for PCM services based on client needs. Based on the five phases of a project life cycle (PLC), the proposed model was used to measure satisfaction with PCM services provided to 19 school construction projects in central Taiwan. It was found that the clients of school construction projects were seeking greater PCM assistance during the planning and construction phases than during any other PLC phase. Compared with other phases, the bid and tender phase received the least demand for PCM assistance. Furthermore, the PCM consultant failed to provide consistent service quality, especially for services during the planning and design phases. Applying PCM to school construction projects is believed to be a feasible approach for improving the quality of Taiwanese school construction.}
