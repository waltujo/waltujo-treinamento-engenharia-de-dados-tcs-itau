The proposed model implies that royalties and subsidies are influenced by the true values bidders assign to a target project and the payoff received by a government from taking up its outside options instead of its bargaining power. In addition, such payoff is vulnerable to collusion. A real case is also detailed to show how reported signals, royalties and subsidies are determined in different cases.}

The present study assessed the effects of comorbidity on the results of QOL measures through an analysis of longitudinal data from 3 double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials dealing with heart-burn, asthma, and ulcer. Patients were assigned to subgroups by comorbidity status: those with no comorbid diseases and those whose principal disease was heartburn, asthma, or ulcer and whose comorbid condition was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or chronic bronchitis; hypertension; migraine, coronary artery disease, or varicose veins; chronic gastrointestinal conditions; arthritis or back pain; diabetes; or depression. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to test the study hypotheses. The study results suggest that comorbid conditions significantly and extensively affect patients' scores on generic QOL measures and estimation of treatment effect, whereas their influence on disease-specific QOL scores and estimation of treatment effect is considerably smaller. Further, the most important comorbidities in the 3 trial populations were arthritis or back pain and depression, which respectively accounted for 17% and 5% of the patient population. These findings have significant practical implications for the estimation of true treatment effects, control of comorbidity effects, and design of QOL trials.}

Marking scheme method is generally used to evaluate the tenders of construction project in China. And the mainly advantage of this method is the application of the expert’s personal knowledge and experience which makes the contractor selection more reasonable. However, if the low scores given by the experts are usually omitted when the marking scheme method is applied, the contractor with certain potential risks may win the bid, which may make the project not be executed and completed in accordance with the contract. To overcome these weaknesses, the outlier detection model, one of Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) method, based on similar coefficient sum was set up in this paper. In this model, the outliers were detected based on the experts’ tender evaluation data of the water projects. Then, the risk factors of contractor’s attributes were obtained and the risk early warning was carried out. The proposed model is used in the tender evaluation decision-making and risk early warning of the water projects in Tianjin, China. The empirical survey was also made to verify the proposed model. From the feedback of the questionnaires, the survey showed that the outliers detection model could detect the latent risks effectively. Accordingly, some advice was given to the employers to prevent the potential risks. Finally, the proposed method and model were introduced into a tender evaluation decision-making and risk early warning system (TEDREWS) for convenient and efficient tender evaluation and risk management.}

We set-up a mixed-integer optimization model including every farm in three agricultural catchments surrounding Limfjorden, the largest fjord in Denmark. We include a number of relevant nitrogen abatement measures, including agricultural land-use measures and mussel farming in the sea. The aim is to model the least costly combination of mitigation measures to improve water quality when agricultural, environmental and market conditions vary. We run three scenarios varying environmental conditions for mussel productivity and market opportunities for mussel-based products as organic animal feed. We analyze the resulting marginal abatement costs and draw insights about the potential scale of mussel farming for the different catchments. We show that mussel farming is a cost-effective option for 2 of the 3 catchments, but that decreasing mussel productivity over time may make the measure ineffective for one of the catchments, if a market for feed is not available. The possibility of a market for mussel-based organic feed significantly increases the share of nitrogen reduction done by mussels and decreases overall costs by up to 65%. Ultimately, the results indicate that, for catchments where environmental conditions are adequate, mussel farming can be a cost-effective nutrient reduction measure. Therefore, mussel farming can potentially increase the cost-effectiveness of incentive schemes aimed at reducing eutrophication in fjords and coastal waters.}

Both target’s and bidder’s shareholders are better-off, but most of the synergistic gains accrue to the target’s shareholders. Targets’ valuation effects are greater for vertical rather than horizontal mergers, indicating a positive valuation for firms that control and manage a more extensive supply chain. The bidders’ wealth effects are greater for friendly mergers. Overall, the findings have important implications for professional practice and the development of the theoretical literature.}

Dronedarone is a strong P-glycoprotein inhibitor with a potential to increase bioavailability of dabigatran. We sought to measure and report plasma concentrations of dabigatran in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on concomitant dronedarone treatment.
Materials and methods
A cohort of 33 patients (mean age 64years, 16 men) concomitantly treated with dabigatran at a dose of 110mg twice a day (bid) and dronedarone at a dose of 400mg bid at the discretion of the patient’s cardiologist were followed prospectively.
Results
Median trough plasma concentration of dabigatran at one week and one month after the concomitant treatment start was 102.0 (range 8-251) ng/ml and 84 (range 27-302) ng/ml respectively. Median treatment length was 13 (range 1-21) months. There was one major bleeding event (2,8% per patient-year) and no thrombotic events during a total of 35.5 patient-years.
Conclusions
Median trough plasma concentration of dabigatran in our study was observed to be similar to median trough plasma concentration of dabigatran at a dose of 150mg bid without concomitant dronedarone in earlier studies with low reported rate of bleeding and thrombosis. Since concomitant treatment offers potential benefits to patients with AF, larger future trials that might refute the current contraindication are warranted.}

Bond yields dropped on average by 30 basis points (bps) (8%) after the CSPP announcement. Tri-party repo turnover rose by 8.15 million USD (29%), and bilateral turnover went up by 7.05 million USD (72%). Bid-ask spreads also showed significant liquidity improvement in eligible bonds. QE was successful in boosting corporate debt issuance. Firms issued 2.19 billion EUR (25%) more in QE-eligible debt after the CSPP announcement, compared to other types of debt. Surprisingly, corporates used the attracted funds mostly to increase dividends. These effects were more pronounced for longer-maturity, lower-rated bonds, and for more credit-constrained, lower-rated firms.}

The research is introduced through a discussion of capital plant manufacture and the factors underlying the management of technical engineering data. Although sales and engineering departments in the capital plant industry are equipped with data processing systems, evidence shows that much information processing is carried out manually, that computer systems are not integrated and that data has to be entered repeatedly at various stages of the bidding, design and manufacturing process. These findings initiated a new approach to product configuration and project management for capital plant manufacture based on engineering data — Engineering Data Control (EDC). The process flow and product structure of the EDC reference architecture is explained to show how the bid and order handling process can be integrated. The core of the paper deals in detail with the generic data structure and system reference architecture developed. An IDEF1X data model was developed to apply the generic reference architecture at a case study site. The suitability of EDC to increase information quality and to provide a concurrent engineering environment integrating all stages of a project life-cycle is discussed. The paper concludes by providing a critical review of the pertinent elements of the EDC reference architecture: the product structure view, the project stages view and the engineering data view.}

The use of water quality tenders to reveal the opportunity costs of changing agricultural practices can help policy makers to understand the potential costs of misallocating public resources and to design better ways of achieving water quality improvements. This role of water quality tenders to reveal opportunity costs is demonstrated by reporting four pilot applications to improve water quality into the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. The results demonstrate the potential for opportunity costs to vary substantially between agricultural producers, and across industries, catchments and pollutants. The results from these case studies indicate that the most cost-effective water quality improvements may be generated from the horticulture and dairy sectors. In contrast, the opportunity costs of reducing emissions from the cane and grazing industries appear to be higher.}

Our analysis of utility-scale PV projects procured through major auctions in developing countries between 2013 and 2016 reveals that low PV prices are viable. PV prices of $0.06–0.08/kWh are consistent with market fundamentals and prices lower than $0.03/kWh are viable under exceptional conditions in some countries. Maintaining low prices while ensuring deployment of quality projects requires a combination of high capacity factors, low equipment prices, low cost of capital, de-risked investment environments, e.g., through the presence of guarantees, and other factors such as particular project developer strategies. Overall, developing countries with abundant local solar resources are well-positioned to drive the global expansion of PV capacity. Well-designed auctions offer a unique opportunity to expand solar PV capacity to many markets in a cost-effective manner.}

abstract = {Abstract 5162
Background:
Ruxolitinib (INC424), a potent and selective oral JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, demonstrated rapid and durable reductions in splenomegaly and improved disease-related symptoms, role functioning, and quality of life (QoL) in 2 phase 3 studies in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) (the COMFORT studies). The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ruxolitinib have been evaluated in non-Asian healthy subjects. However, its ethnic sensitivity has not been investigated. This is the first study in Japan to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of ruxolitinib in healthy Japanese volunteers.
Methods:
There were 4 dose cohorts with 10 male subjects in each, 8 randomized to receive ruxolitinib and 2 randomized to receive placebo. In cohort 1 (10 mg) and cohort 2 (25 mg), each subject received a single dose (QD) of ruxolitinib or placebo on day 1 and received twice daily (bid) doses on days 4 through 10. In cohorts 3 and 4, subjects received a single dose of ruxolitinib (50 and 100 mg, respectively) or placebo on day 1. Serial blood samples for PK analysis were collected up to 48 hours post-dose, and ruxolitinib concentrations were analyzed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. PK parameters were derived from individual plasma concentration time data using non-compartmental analysis. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.
Results:
The median age of the 40 enrolled healthy subjects was 27 years. Ruxolitinib was rapidly absorbed (Cmax achieved 0.5 hours after dosing), and exposure increased dose proportionally between 10 and 100 mg (Table). Consistent with the half-life of 2–3 hours and a 12-hour dosing interval, drug accumulation was not observed after repeated dosing. These results are similar to those obtained in non-Japanese healthy volunteers (Shi JG, et al. J Clin Pharmacol, May 20, 2011 [epub ahead of print]).

Consistent with ruxolitinib's inhibition of the JAK pathway, grade 2 decreases in absolute neutrophil counts were observed in 5 subjects (3 in the 10-mg bid cohort, 1 in the 25-mg bid cohort, and 1 in the 100-mg QD cohort). However, these neutrophil decreases were managed with dose reductions in 2 subjects (1 each in the 10- and 25-mg bid cohorts) or without dose reductions in 3 subjects and rapidly recovered after the last administration of the study drug. Laboratory values showed that a similar decrease in neutrophils was also observed in subjects randomized to placebo. One subject (25-mg bid cohort) experienced a grade 1 increase in alanine aminotransferase 3 days following the last dose. All AEs resolved during the study without any treatment and were not dose dependent.
Conclusions:
Orally administered ruxolitinib has a predictable PK and is well tolerated in healthy Japanese volunteers. There are no apparent ethnic differences in the PK of ruxolitinib between Japanese and non-Japanese subjects.

abstract = {Objectives
To discuss the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) criteria for measuring performance in asthma care and to review new strategies to improve the quality of asthma care.
Data Sources
Expert opinion from a roundtable on National Committee for Quality Assurance HEDIS and asthma care, supplemented with a MEDLINE database search to identify articles published between January 1, 1990, and May 31, 2005, with the following keywords in the title: asthma plus HEDIS, pay for performance, incentive programs, reimbursement, or employee education.
Study Selection
Studies and review articles were selected for their relevance to measuring the quality of asthma care using HEDIS and improving care using newer trends, such as employee education and physician incentive programs.
Results
Components of the HEDIS asthma measure have been found to correlate with outcomes, including risk of hospitalization and emergency department visits. However, refinements to the measure may be needed because it may misclassify a portion of patients as having persistent asthma who actually have intermittent asthma according to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria. Physician incentive programs are increasingly being explored as a means of improving the quality of care while managing costs. Under current pay-for-performance programs, rewards are issued to providers who demonstrate high-quality care based on the HEDIS asthma measure.
Conclusions
The HEDIS asthma measure remains the most widely used performance tool for evaluating the quality of asthma care. Reimbursement models based on public reporting and pay for performance are expected to be a strong component of future health care payment systems.}

At e-marketplaces, where many services can be dynamically searched and used, an auction is a key technology for realizing market-based negotiations among ‘software agents’. Although some algorithms for reducing complexity have been proposed, they are only suitable for one-shot auctions where bidders submit bids only once simultaneously. Thus, we reduce computational burdens by using the previous valuation of bids for doing the next valuation. We then verify the effectiveness through evaluation.}

Moreover, sentiment indicators have predictability for future price trends though the profitability of news-implied trading is deteriorated by increased bid-ask spreads.}

Two variables are taken into account in the bidding process: price and duration of the given engineering activity. From a theoretical viewpoint, we fully determine optimal suppliers’ bidding strategies and expected outcomes, i.e. score/utility, price and duration, for the buyer under both first score sealed bid and second score sealed bid auctions. We show that this two schemes are equivalent in terms of score/utility even in presence of multi-dimensional suppliers’ private information. Therefore, they could be used interchangeably. Under a specific score function, we also perform a simulation showing that: (i) auction expected outcomes for the Main Contractor are very sensitive when duration reduction is a critical issue and (ii) number of bidders affects score and price but not duration.}

Yet even when the fundamentals justify stock payment, paying with cash is common. In that way, firms can preclude paying with undervalued stock and are more likely to experience positive long-term excess returns.}

Using high-frequency data we document cross-market liquidity dynamics, demonstrating that entrant markets need to trade (not only quote) in order to improve liquidity, and that endogenous liquidity suppliers increase their usage of the alternate market when queues on the incumbent exchange are long and quoted spreads are constrained by the minimum tick size, consistent with queue-jumping order duplication.}

It draws on the literature and the case of two UK school PPP contracts with varying degree of trust among the partners to illustrate the role of control in building competence trust and goodwill trust, and how trust in turn affects control. Prior to entering into the PPP contract, under a condition of high risk and low trust, reliance was placed on formal control to evaluate competence trust for the purpose of selecting a preferred bidder, whilst goodwill trust, which takes time to evolve, played no role in the selection process. During contract implementation, formal control formed the basis for demonstrating competence and nurturing goodwill trust. Trust subsequently determined the extent of reliance on formal control and informal control. In the case of School 1, high level of trust led to a reliance on informal control which enabled partners to focus resources on solving problems, whilst formal control operated in the background. In the case of School 2, low level of trust and perceived lack of transparency led to a demand for additional formal control. This study adds to the trust-control literature by shedding light on how trust relates to control, in the context of long-term PPP contracts which are difficult to specify in advance.}

abstract = {Introduction
Within the UK approximately 5000 surgical and 12,000 percutaneous tracheostomies are performed annually. Whilst an essential component of patient care, the presence of a tracheostomy is not without concern. Landmark papers have demonstrated recurrent themes related to the provision of training, staff and equipment, leading to avoidable patient harm, life-altering morbidity and mortality. The development of the Global Tracheostomy Collaborative (GTC) and the Improving Tracheostomy Care (ITC) project have provided the necessary infrastructure to make improvements, with individual organizations responsible for its implementation.
Method
This quality improvement project, funded by the NHS Wales Critical Care and Trauma Network, developed a dedicated tracheostomy team to improve the quality of care provided to those patients requiring a tracheostomy through staff education, equipment standardisation and multidisciplinary tracheostomy ward rounds. Global Tracheostomy membership was funded through involvement in the ITC project.
Results
Formal tracheostomy teaching was delivered by the tracheostomy team to 165 clinicians involved in tracheostomy care. Improvements in self-assessed confidence with knowledge and were observed for all aspects of tracheostomy care. Standardisation and centralisation resulted in reduction in waste and unnecessary variation. Compliance with ‘emergency tracheostomy blue box’ availability with an increase from 5% to 100%. Comparison of data from the QI period against baseline data, demonstrated improvement in rates of decannulation, and non-significant improvements in time to decannulation, critical care and hospital length of stay. Additionally, there were associated reductions in adverse events.
Conclusion
This QI project, supported by involvement with the GTC and ITC, resulted in reductions in adverse events, improved patient safety, non-significant reduction in time to achieve weaning milestones and a reduction in hospital length of stay.}

Results confirm that the optimal public reserve price policy dominates for the buyer when the lowest cost supplier is weakly risk-averse but in contrast with theory, the secret reserve price policy does not dominate when he becomes very risk-averse. Analysis of strategic suppliers׳ bidding behavior shows, in conformity with theory, that they react to the secret reserve price and are more aggressive when they are more risk-averse. This explains why the optimal public reserve price does not perform better in this context but is equivalent to the secret one. However, strongly risk-averse bidders are less aggressive than predicted by theory. That is why the secret reserve price policy does not strictly dominate.}

In this paper, we study the relationship between final prices of online auctions and shill activities. We conduct experiments on real auction data from eBay to examine the hypotheses that state how the difference between final auction price and expected auction price implies shill bidding. In the experiments, a neural network based approach is used to learn the expected auction price. In particular, we trained the Large Memory Storage and Retrieval (LAMSTAR) Neural Network based on features extracted from item descriptions, listings and other auction properties. The likelihood of shill bidding is determined by a previously proposed shill certification technique based on Dempster–Shafer theory. By employing the chi-square test of independence and logistic regression, the experimental results indicate that a higher-than-expected final auction price might be used as direct evidence to distinguish likely shill-infected auctions from trustworthy auctions, allowing for more focused evaluation of shill-suspected auctions. As such, this work contributes to providing a feasible way to identify suspicious auctions that may contain shill biddings. It may also help to develop trustworthy auction houses with shill detection services that can protect honest bidders and benefit the auction markets in both the short-term and long term.}

abstract = {Background
The combination of fluticasone furoate (FF), a novel inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol (VI), a long-acting β2 agonist, is under development as a once-daily treatment of asthma and COPD. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of FF/VI with fluticasone propionate (FP)/salmeterol (SAL) in patients with persistent asthma uncontrolled on a medium dose of ICS.
Methods
In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study, 806 patients received FF/VI (100/25 μg, n = 403) once daily in the evening delivered through ELLIPTA (GlaxoSmithKline) dry powder inhaler, or FP/SAL (250/50 μg, n = 403) bid through DISKUS/ACCUHALER (GlaxoSmithKline). The primary efficacy measure was 0- to 24-h serial weighted mean (wm) FEV1 after 24 weeks of treatment.
Results
Improvements from baseline in 0- to 24-h wmFEV1 were observed with both FF/VI (341 mL) and FP/SAL (377 mL); the adjusted mean treatment difference was not statistically significant (−37 mL; 95% CI, −88 to 15, P = 0.162). There were no differences between 0- to 4-h serial wmFEV1, trough FEV1, and asthma control and quality-of-life questionnaire scores. There was no difference in reported exacerbations between treatments. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no clinically relevant effect on urinary cortisol excretion or vital signs and no treatment-related serious adverse events.
Conclusions
The efficacy of once-daily FF/VI was similar to bid FP/SAL in improving lung function in patients with persistent asthma. No safety issues were identified.

Sometimes, many bidders have made wrong decisions (e.g., “Winner Curse”) due to their limited knowledge and resources. Unfortunately, search engines only show a list of search results to users, and fail to provide further analysis that could help improve users’ decision-making. To solve this problem, this study proposed an intelligent spider for information retrieval, and applied data mining technology to differentiate between customers. Two software programs, a URL searching agent and an auction data agent, are developed to automatically collect related information whenever users input the searched product. Two neural networks are used to perform data clustering and price prediction after this information is crawled and stored into a database. The first neural network adopts a self-organizing map (SOM) to cluster customer data into nine homogenous groups. The second backpropagation network (BPN) is then used to predict the final price. This study develops a prototype of the proposed spider, and conducts an empirical study by crawling over 1000 deals from Taiwan’s eBay. Finally, important information, such as predicted price, prediction error and historic records, are presented to the user. The user can thus easily target the right bidding policy for wining a bid based on the mining-based information about price prediction.}

In this study, how fat content affects the bid price at auction was investigated by using 150 Pacific bluefin tuna Thunnus orientalis caught around the Yaeyama Islands, southern Japan. Eight factors, year (2015 or 2016), auction site (four categories), date (calendar date), fishing gear (longline or pole-line), condition at catch (alive or dead), sex (female or male), body weight (108–350 kg), and fatness (four independent indicators listed below), were used as explanatory variables, and their effects on the bid price at auction were analyzed using a log-normal generalized linear model. The condition factor (body weight relative to the cube of length), percentage of fat content of the belly, near the first dorsal fin, and near the anal fin estimated by bioelectrical impedance were used as indices of fatness, and the use of fat content near the anal fin area reduced AIC the most. Fish still alive at catch, smaller fish, and fatter fish were sold at higher prices. Of the three areas, fat content near the anal fin had the highest correlation with condition factor, which is an objective indicator to predict fish fatness visually. Fat content near the anal fin is concluded to be a good indicator to predict fatness of the whole body of the fish and therefore the auction prices.}

It relies on two settlement metrics; the local average and gradient functions that quantify the notions of settlement density and flexible settlement limits respectively. They are both utilized as generalization functions for increasing the level of abstraction of the sets under comparison. Generalization compensates for inaccuracies of the automatic target extraction method and can be computed at multiple scales. The comparison between the target built-up layers and the reference data employs an ordered multi-scale, linear regression computing the goodness of fit measure R2. An optimized assessment procedure is investigated in a pilot study and is further employed in a big data exercise. A newly introduced quality metric returns the agreement between automatically extracted built-up from a set of 13605 scenes and the MODIS 500 urban layer, that was found too be as high as 91% for selected sensors. A final experiment attempts a performance increase at lower scales by correlating the target layer with automatically selected training subsets. At 50m the adjusted R2 increases by 3% with a mean squared error improvement of 2% compared to the performance achieved without statistical learning. The experiment suggests that the GHSL assessment at a global scale can be carried out based on limited high resolution reference data of minimal spatial coverage.}

This study serves as an initial investigation of these hybrid mechanisms, exploring theoretically and experimentally how the opportunity to obtain a homogeneous good in a subsequent lottery affects Nash equilibrium bids in discriminative and uniform price auctions. The lottery imposes an opportunity cost to winning the auction, systematically reducing equilibrium auction bids. In contrast to the uniform price auction, equilibrium bids in the uniform price hybrid mechanism vary with bidder risk preferences. Experimental evidence suggests that the presence of the lottery and risk attitudes (elicited through a preceding experiment) impact auction bids in the directions predicted by theory. Finally, we find that theoretically and experimentally, the subsequent lottery does not compromise the efficiency of the auction component of the hybrid mechanisms.}

We find that the vertical rent curve is non-monotonic with respect to floor level. Specifically, residential bidders pay a 1.5 to 3.5% ground floor premium. For the remaining vertical locations, the slope of the vertical rent curve is positive with respect to floor level. Our analysis shows that the ground floor premium is indeed a valuation of access similar to the valuation of access to the Central Business District (CBD) in a monocentric setting. Based on the cities in our sample, the ground floor premium is roughly equivalent to moving between 250–450 m closer to the CBD. The positive slope of the vertical rent curve, with respect to floor level, is predominately explained by amenities (e.g. views) that compensate residents for the lack of easy access to the street. Furthermore, our analysis provides evidence of an equilibrium relationship between rental prices and proximity to initially high-priced areas that is consistent with rental price spillovers. More precisely, dwellings at higher vertical locations exhibit stronger rental price growth if they are located closer to an initially expensive neighborhood compared to dwellings on lower floor levels.}

The availability of machine readable transaction databases have allowed empirical tests based on unprecedented sample sizes and detail. We review both aggregate takeover activity and the takeover process itself as it evolves from the initial bid through the final contest outcome. The evidence includes determinants of strategic choices such as the takeover method (merger v. tender offer), the size of opening bids and bid jumps, the payment method, toehold acquisition, the response to target defensive tactics, and regulatory intervention (antitrust), and it offers links to executive compensation. The data provides fertile grounds for tests of everything ranging from signaling theories under asymmetric information to strategic competition in product markets and to issues of agency and control. The evidence is supportive of neoclassical merger theories. For example, regulatory and technological changes, and shocks to aggregate liquidity, appear to drive out market-to-book ratios as fundamental drivers of merger waves. Despite the market boom in the second half of the 1990s, the proportion of all-stock offers in more than 13,000 merger bids did not change from the first half of the decade. While some bidders experience large losses (particularly in the years 1999 and 2000), combined value-weighted announcement-period returns to bidders and targets are significantly positive on average. Long-run post-takeover abnormal stock returns are not significantly different from zero when using a performance measure that replicates a feasible portfolio trading strategy. There are unresolved econometric issues of endogeneity and self-selection.}

Our results suggest that improvements in time-varying country-level factors, including location advantages (market size, human capital and efficiency opportunities), national governance quality, and stock market development are associated with an increase in the volume of M&A activity. Consistent with the resource-curse paradox, high resource endowments are not associated with increased levels of M&A. In support of the management inefficiency, but contrary to the traditional firm size hypotheses, African targets are generally characterised by declining stock returns and accounting profitability, but are more likely to be larger firms; suggesting the presence of information asymmetry concerns in their selection. Notwithstanding, we find evidence of heterogeneity across countries with inconsistent support for the established target prediction hypotheses. Overall, our analysis suggests that a model which combines firm- and country-specific factors better explains the observed variations in African M&A activity.}

Scandal is a last resort act that makes the deal widely salient through transformation of the bid into a national threat. Target country actors threatened by the CBMA skillfully use scandal, along with their corporate political activities (CPA), to hinder deals that they could not have stopped otherwise. It is mainly the inadequacy of the CPA efforts that lead to emergence of scandal. Once condemned of wrongdoing, the acquirers instantly become persona non grata, even in the cases where the government is supportive of the deal.}

Previous works have tackled the exposure problem with heuristic strategies that employ probabilistic price predictions—so-called price-prediction strategies. We introduce a concept of self-confirming prices, and show that within an independent private value model, Bayes–Nash equilibrium can be fully characterized as a profile of optimal price-prediction strategies with self-confirming prices. We operationalize this observation by exhibiting a practical procedure to compute near-self-confirming price predictions given a price-prediction strategy. An extensive empirical game-theoretic analysis demonstrates that bidding strategies that use such predictions are effective in simultaneous auctions with both complementary and substitutable preference structures. In particular, we produce one such strategy that finds near-optimal bids, thereby outperforming all previously studied bidding heuristics in these environments.}

Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor.
Objective
This study assessed tofacitinib efficacy and safety vs placebo in Asian patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
Methods
Patients from China mainland, Taiwan, and Korea were randomized 2:2:1:1 to tofacitinib 5mg (N=88), tofacitinib 10mg (N=90), placebo→5mg (N=44), or placebo→10mg (N=44), twice daily (BID) for 52 weeks. Placebo-treated patients advanced to tofacitinib at Week 16. Co-primary efficacy endpoints: proportions of patients achieving Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) response (‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’) and proportion achieving ≥75% reduction from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) at Week 16.
Results
At Week 16, more patients achieved PGA and PASI75 responses with tofacitinib 5mg (52.3%; 54.6%) and 10mg (75.6%; 81.1%) BID vs placebo (19.3%; 12.5%; all p<0.0001). Of patients with a Week 16 response, 73.6% and 75.0% maintained PGA response, and 76.8% and 84.9% maintained PASI75 to Week 52 with tofacitinib 5mg and 10mg BID, respectively. Over 52 weeks, 2.2–4.5% of patients across treatment groups experienced serious adverse events, and 1.1–6.8% discontinued due to adverse events.
Conclusion
Tofacitinib demonstrated efficacy vs placebo at Week 16 in Asian patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; efficacy was maintained through Week 52. No unexpected safety findings were observed. [NCT01815424]}

Late bidding may also arise out of equilibrium, as a best reply to incremental bidding. However, the strategic advantages of late bidding are severely attenuated in auctions that apply an automatic extension rule such as auctions conducted on Amazon. Field data show that there is more late bidding on eBay than on Amazon, and this difference grows with experience. We also study the incidence of multiple bidding, and its relation to late bidding.}

Using a case study approach of five Swedish road construction projects, the present paper compares these contracting forms in terms of innovation. In this, the client's labelling of a contract being DB or DBB is taken at face value. It is established that the actual degrees of freedom for the contractors are highly restricted and that no important difference can be seen between the contracting forms regarding innovation. This implies that it is no reason to expect more innovation simply by labelling contracts as DB. Rational explanations for the usage of DB-contracts with bounds on the degrees of freedom are also suggested. Policy implications for promoting innovation in infrastructure contracting finalise the study.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
GLORIA-AF is a large, global, prospective registry program of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with ≥1 stroke risk factors. We describe the effectiveness and safety of dabigatran etexilate over 2 years from routine clinical practice in nearly 3000 patients from GLORIA-AF who are newly diagnosed with non-valvular AF and at risk of stroke.
Methods
Consecutive enrollment into phase II of GLORIA-AF was initiated following approval of dabigatran for stroke prevention in non-valvular AF. Within this Phase II, 2937 dabigatran patients completed 2-year follow-up by May 2016 and were eligible for analysis. Patients who took at least 1 dose of dabigatran (n=2932) were used to estimate incidence rates.
Results
Overall incidence rates per 100 person-years of 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.92) for stroke, 1.12 (0.83-1.49) for major bleeding, 0.47 (0.29-0.72) for myocardial infarction, and 2.69 (2.22-3.23) for all-cause death were observed. For patients taking 150 mg dabigatran twice daily (BID), corresponding rates (95% CI) were 0.56 (0.30-0.94), 1.00 (0.64-1.47), 0.48 (0.25-0.83), and 2.07 (1.55-2.72), respectively. For patients taking 110 mg dabigatran BID, event rates (95% CI) were 0.67 (0.33-1.20), 1.16 (0.70-1.80), 0.43 (0.17-0.88), and 3.16 (2.36-4.15).
Conclusions
These global data confirm the sustained safety and effectiveness of dabigatran over 2 years of follow-up, consistent with the results from clinical trials as well as contemporary real-world studies.
What is known
• Non–vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulants (NOACs) are the preferred therapy for prevention of ischemic stroke based on phase 3 trials, but there is insufficient information on their efficacy and safety in daily practice, based on prospectively collected data.
What is new
• This study shows that in non-valvular AF patient population, with up to 2 years of follow-up, the use of dabigatran led to a low incidence of ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and myocardial infarction in routine clinical care, confirming the sustained safety and effectiveness of dabigatran in clinical practice over 2 years of follow-up.}

abstract = {The “BH3-only” proteins of the BCL-2 family require “multidomain” proapoptotic members BAX and BAK to release cytochrome c from mitochondria and kill cells. We find short peptides representing the α-helical BH3 domains of BID or BIM are capable of inducing oligomerization of BAK and BAX to release cytochrome c. Another subset characterized by the BH3 peptides from BAD and BIK cannot directly activate BAX, BAK but instead binds antiapoptotic BCL-2, resulting in the displacement of BID-like BH3 domains that initiate mitochondrial dysfunction. Transduced BAD-like and BID-like BH3 peptides also displayed synergy in killing leukemic cells. These data support a two-class model for BH3 domains: BID-like domains that “activate” BAX, BAK and BAD-like domains that “sensitize” by occupying the pocket of antiapoptotic members.}

abstract = {Background
Proton pump inhibitors may foster intestinal dysbiosis and related bowel symptoms.
Aim
To evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus paracasei F19 on bowel symptom onset in patients on long-term proton pump inhibitors.
Methods
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with typical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms receiving pantoprazole 40mg/d for six months were randomly assigned to receive: (A) Lactobacillus paracasei F19 bid for three days/week for six months; (B) placebo bid for three days/week for six months; (C) Lactobacillus paracasei F19 bid for three days/week for three months and placebo bid for three days/week for the following three months; (D) placebo bid for three days/week for three months and Lactobacillus paracasei F19 bid for three days/week for the following three months. Bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain and bowel habit were assessed monthly.
Results
100/312 patients were enrolled. In the parallel groups, the treatment-by-time interaction affected bloating (p=0.015), while Lactobacillus paracasei F19 treatment alone affected flatulence (p=0.011). Moreover, the treatment-by-time interaction significantly affected the mean score of bloating (p=0.01) and flatulence (p<0.0001), the mean stool form (p=0.03) and mean stool frequency/week (p=0.016). Analysis of the cross-over groups, limited to the first three months because of carry-over effect, confirmed these results.
Conclusion
Lactobacillus paracasei F19 supplementation prevents bowel symptom onset in patients on long-term proton pump inhibitors.}

Using a sample of Chinese firms, we show a positive relationship between governance and liquidity. We also find striking differences between firms faced with different types of agency conflicts. Specifically, governance measures such as management compensation, controlling shareholder monitoring and board independence are more effective in lowering the bid-ask spread for state-owned enterprises prone to management entrenchment. In contrast, multiple-layer corporate structures and a higher degree of separation between control and cash flow rights are associated with higher bid-ask spreads in non-state firms characterized by self-serving controlling shareholders. Our study highlights how governance might have different liquidity effects between firms faced with different types of agency conflicts.}

Findings indicate that more acculturated and female consumers are more in favour of purchasing certified halal labelled meat in a supermarket. Important conditions are that supermarkets can provide a guarantee of separating halal from non-halal meat and of the organisation of adequate verification and control. Results further show that more Muslim consumers are willing to pay a price premium (of 13% on average) for halal labelled meat at the Islamic butcher shop than at the supermarket. The higher the importance attached to a certified halal label and the more distrust in the actual halal meat status, the higher the likelihood that a Muslim consumer is willing to pay a higher price for certified halal labelled meat at the Islamic butcher shop. Gender and generation determine the actual premium Muslim consumers are willing to pay.}

Such settings are common in finance and other areas of economics. Our model allows for heterogeneous nonparametric covariate effects as well as unobserved time and individual specific effects that may depend on the covariates in an arbitrary way. To model the covariate effects parsimoniously, we impose a dimensionality reducing common component structure on them. In the theoretical part of the paper, we derive the asymptotic theory for the proposed procedure. In particular, we provide the convergence rates and the asymptotic distribution of our estimators. In the empirical part, we apply our methodology to a specific application that has been the subject of recent policy interest, that is, the effect of trading venue fragmentation on market quality. We use a unique dataset that reports the location and volume of trading on the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies from 2008 to 2011 at the weekly frequency. We find that the effect of fragmentation on market quality is nonlinear and non-monotonic. The implied quality of the market under perfect competition is superior to that under monopoly provision, but the transition between the two is complicated.}

It has been mooted as a means of utilising low-cost or otherwise curtailed electricity to produce an advanced transport fuel, whilst facilitating intermittent renewable electricity through grid balancing measures and decentralised storage of electricity. This paper investigates the interaction of a 10MWe P2G facility with an island electricity grid with limited interconnection, through modelling electricity purchase. Three models are tested; 2016 at 25% renewable electricity penetration and 2030 at both 40% and 60% penetration levels. The relationships between electricity bid price, average cost of electricity and run hours were established whilst the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) was evaluated for the gaseous fuel produced. Bidding for electricity above the average marginal cost of generation in the system (€35–50/MWeh) was found to minimise the LCOE in all three scenarios. The frequency of low-cost and high-costs hours, analogous to balancing issues, increased with increasing shares of variable renewable electricity generation. However, basing P2G systems on low-cost (less than €10/MWeh) hours alone (999 h in 2030 at 60% renewable penetration) is not the path to financial optimisation; it is preferential to increase the run hours to a level that amortises the capital expenditure.}

abstract = {Success of a contracted project requires collaborative effort from many parties, such as the project owner, the winning tender or contractor, and various suppliers in between. Many studies have been conducted in tender evaluation occurring early in the project life cycle from project owner’s viewpoint. However, responsible tenders are also necessary to evaluate the quality of a potential project owner to ensure that a bid/no-bid decision is correctly made. Such a decision-making problem is likely based on some uncertain factors and imprecise information about a particular owner. Fuzzy theory and probability have been commonly used in general evaluation problems. Since either works within its specified domain, integration of these two approaches within a unique domain becomes a difficult task. In this paper, we explore the usefulness of a novel evaluation model that combines both cloud theory and utility theory together for supporting decision making of multi-attribute evaluation problems under uncertainty. An application of this novel approach to owner evaluation demonstrates that this proposed novel approach is not only useful in dealing with owner evaluation in tendering, but also generic for solving multi-attribute evaluation problems in many disciplines.}

abstract = {This paper reviews the laboratory research on conservation auctions by first suggesting a framework for organizing the literature; then by highlighting the key insights and contributions achieved to date; and thirdly by taking stock of pending questions and unresolved problems. The review framework focuses on the performance of conservation auctions and distinguishes between causal factors and resulting effects. Causal factors include auction format, implementation rules and bidder characteristics, as well as some other aspects. Resulting effects distinguish between intermediate effects, mainly in terms of bidder behaviour, and final auction performance. Rather than a standard literature review, this ‘overview’ also tries to capture the work that is currently going on and that has not yet been published.}

Alternative methods therefore need to be implemented that improve animal welfare and solve the underlying problem of boar taint. This paper explores German organic consumers' preferences for piglet castration without pain relief and three alternative methods. In an innovative approach using a multi-criteria decision making procedure, qualitative data from focus group discussions were compared with quantitative results from Vickrey auctions. Overall, participants preferred all alternatives to castration without pain relief. Different aspects influenced willingness-to-pay for the methods. Animal welfare was important for the evaluation of castration without pain relief and castration with anaesthesia. Food safety played a major role for willingness-to-pay for immunocastration, while taste and, to some extent, animal welfare were dominant factors for fattening of boars. These differences should be considered when communicating the alternatives.}

abstract = {Background
Patients with COPD have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Despite the clinical benefits of long-acting β-agonist agents in the treatment of COPD, patients may be at an increased risk of cardiovascular toxicity, including tachyarrhythmia due to β-adrenergic stimulation.
Objective
To evaluate the cardiovascular safety of salmeterol in COPD patients by conducting a pooled analysis of cardiovascular safety data.
Design
Randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multiple-dose studies, which included salmeterol, 50 μg bid, and placebo arms.
Study selection
Seven of a total of 17 studies met the predefined inclusion requirements and were pooled. A total of 1,443 patients received placebo, while 1,410 patients received salmeterol, 50 μg bid. The median duration of treatment was 24 weeks (range, 12 to 52 weeks).
Results
Treatment with salmeterol, 50 μg bid, showed no increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) compared with placebo (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.3; p = 0.838). Both groups had a similar incidence of cardiovascular events (8%), including cardiovascular deaths. The incidence of cardiovascular AEs increased with age, concurrent cardiovascular conditions, and treatment with antiarrhythmic/bradycardic agents, although increases were comparable in both treatment groups. There were no episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, and no clinically significant differences were observed in 24-h heart rate, ventricular and supraventricular ectopic events, qualitative ECGs, QT intervals, or vital signs between the salmeterol, 50 μg bid, group and the placebo group. Similar findings were observed when patients were stratified for age of > 65 years or the known presence of cardiovascular disease.
Conclusions
Treatment with salmeterol, 50 μg bid, does not increase the risk of cardiovascular AEs in this population of COPD patients compared with placebo.}

Though the literature comes up with some means to calibrate the estimated preferences ex-post, this is far from being unproblematic and uncontroversial. In this paper we test whether a short ex-ante entreaty, presented to respondents in a health economic stated preference survey, can effectively reduce the number of protest zero bids. We first of all find that the protest reduction entreaty significantly reduces the number of protest zero bids in the survey. Furthermore, the results indicate that marginal demand for the individual attributes as well as general preferences do not seem to be influenced by the protest reduction entreaty. Compared to the traditional ex-post calibration of protest zero bids in stated preference surveys, these results suggest that an ex-ante reduction in protest zero bids by using a simple and short entreaty is possible without introducing other types of biases in the survey.}

In the European Union legislation, the most economically advantageous tender is also considered as an award criterion, encompassing in fact many sub-criteria. The pros and cons of both approaches have extensively been discussed in the literature. Therefore, the choice of a procurement method that will combine the merits of both approaches to the wider possible extent is of utmost importance. In this paper, a new award method based on the most economically advantageous tender is proposed. The sub-criteria considered are construction cost, completion time and warranty offered by each bidder. Their objective evaluation is carried out by implementing utility theory. An illustrative worked example is provided.}

Given the quality of Chile's government (i.e., level of accountability, political stability, effectiveness, regulatory quality, control over corruption, and adherence to the rule of law), rent allocation has likely been suboptimal and institutional change is likely warranted.}

We conclude that information which is unavailable during typical market transactions is important to how consumers value maize, and that imperfect information may contribute to the prevalence of agricultural production for subsistence needs in developing countries.}

Leverage increases target management’s negotiating position with the bidder, potentially thwarting the acquisition altogether. Target management should therefore have less incentive to increase leverage where investor protections are weak and financial regulations favor incumbents. Examining changes in firm leverage in an international sample of target firms, we find that targets significantly increase leverage around takeover attempts, but only in countries with well-developed capital markets and strong investor protections. These target firms realize negative abnormal returns around debt issuance announcements, especially those between takeover announcement and withdrawal. Further, target shareholders suffer significantly negative long-term returns after the takeover bid is withdrawn. Negative returns are significantly mitigated, but not eliminated, with high performance target managers in place.}

Two fundamental properties of knowledge underlie the model: First, it is often necessary to reveal some knowledge to demonstrate its value. Second, knowledge is freely reproducible. Larger cities generate more meetings between experts and entrepreneurs, resulting in more learning and better matches. Larger cities also foster competition for jobs, which motivates experts to raise their knowledge bids. These results demonstrate how competitive behavior can be a source of agglomeration economies, and contribute to explain the higher productivity of urban workers.}

Since the procurement agent is also in charge of verifying delivered quality, in exchange for a bribe, he can allow an arbitrary firm to be awarded the realization of the project and to produce a quality level lower than that announced. We compute equilibrium corruption and we study the impact on corruption of the competitiveness of the environment, and in particular of: (i) an increase in the number of potential suppliers of the good or service to be procured, and (ii) an increase of competition in the market for procurement agents. We identify the effects that influence equilibrium corruption and show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, corruption may well be increasing in competition.}

abstract = {Background
Limited access to essential medicines for maternal and child health is a preventable cause of pregnancy-related deaths. This remains a predominant challenge in Nigeria, where sub-standard and falsified medications have historically been associated with maternal mortality. An in-depth understanding of perceptions surrounding quality assurance of essential medicines is pertinent for developing effective and sustainable interventions.
Objective
To examine stakeholder perspectives on quality control of essential medicines for maternal and child health, while characterizing pharmaceutical distribution of medicines in Nigeria.
Methods
Key informant interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 26 participants between January and June 2018. Eligible participants included: pharmacists, pharmaceutical sales representatives (pharm reps), supply chain employees of pharmaceutical industries and regulatory agency personnel, working in the public or private health sector in either of the four states: Lagos, Enugu, Imo or Port-Harcourt. A 6-item survey was administered to collect demographic information on the participants. This was followed by 15 semi-structured questions to gather qualitative data on the subject matter.
Results
Verifying vendor credibility and use of identifiable regulatory markers were the most common methods adopted by pharmacists and pharm reps with the intent to control quality of medicines. Key challenges in assuring quality included: inefficiency of regulatory agencies, illicit sales of prescription medicines by patent medicine vendors, existence of open markets and failed policy implementation. While pharmacists and pharm reps solicited improved regulations and policy implementation; NAFDAC personnel primarily recommended an increased government funding to improve their efficiency.
Conclusion
Beyond stakeholder recommendations, a fervent and consistent commitment on the part of the government is needed to improve quality assurance in Nigeria's pharmaceutical system. Public-private partnerships should be explored to address funding limitations to quality assurance. Future studies need to examine challenges and opportunities surrounding policy implementation, and regulatory enforcement in pharmaceutical distribution.}

abstract = {Background: Modern premixed insulins offer a flexible approach to the initiation of insulin therapy in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. A disadvantage of twice-daily regimens of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) is that lunchtime control (when no insulin is administered) can be suboptimal. Therefore, it is possible that administering BIAsp 30 thrice daily might further optimize glycemic control and offer an option for patients in whom metformin (MET) is contraindicated. Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety profiles of 2 different regimens of BIAsp 30 compared with a regimen consisting of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) alone. Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial, insulin-naive patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (baseline glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c ≥8.0%) who were taking OADs (a sulfonylurea or meglitinide with/without MET or MET only) were randomized to receive BIAsp 30 TID, BIAsp 30 BID + MET, or continuation of their current OAD therapy for 16 weeks. The primary end point was HbA1c at the end of the study. Secondary end points included reductions in HbA1c, mean blood glucose (BG), prandial increment, mean 7-point self-monitored BG profile, weight changes, tolerability (hypoglycemia, adverse events), and satisfaction/quality of life (derived from 2 questionnaires completed at weeks 0, 8, and 16). Results: The study enrolled 308 insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes (78.9% female; mean age, 58.3 years; body mass index, 29.4 kg/m2; HbA1c, 10.3%). Both BIAsp 30 TID and BIAsp 30 BID + MET were associated with significantly greater mean (SD) reductions in HbA1c relative to OADs alone (absolute percent reduction: 2.9% [1.5%], 3.0% [1.6%], and 2.1% [1.4%], respectively; P < 0.001, both insulin groups vs OAD group) and improved post-prandial glucose control (reduction in mean post-prandial glucose:−6.32 [4.07], −6.44 [4.70], and −3.59 [4.22] mmol/L; P < 0.001, both insulin groups vs OAD group). The mean decrease in the prandial increment was −1.26 mmol/L for BIAsp 30 TID, −2.15 mmol/L for BIAsp 30 BID + MET, and −0.44 mmol/L for OAD. The differences in reduction in the prandial increment were statistically significant for BIAsp 30 TID versus OAD (P = 0.047), BIAsp 30 BID + MET versus OAD (P < 0.001), and BIAsp 30 TID versus BIAsp 30 BID + MET (P = 0.042). Mean body weight increased significantly from baseline with both BIAsp 30 TID and BIAsp 30 BID + MET (+1.71 and +1.50 kg, respectively; both, P < 0.001), and decreased significantly in the OAD group (−0.75 kg; P = 0.003). There were no major hypoglycemic events, and most hypoglycemic events were recorded as symptoms only (144/158 [91.1%]). There were no significant differences in the mean frequency of overall hypoglycemic episodes between BIAsp 30 TID and BIAsp 30 BID + MET (0.73 and 0.69 episodes per patient-year, respectively). Conclusions: In these patients with type 2 diabetes that was poorly controlled by OADs, BIAsp 30 TID and BIAsp 30 BID plus MET were associated with significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and postprandial BG compared with OADs alone. The insulin regimens were associated with significantly more weight gain than OADs alone. There were no differences in rates of hypoglycemia between the insulin regimens.}

abstract = {In order to get the goods, a buyer must search for the items through several auction sites in Internet. When the auction starts, the buyer needs to connect to these auction sites frequently so that he can monitor the bid states and re-bid. In this paper, we propose an automated negotiation model between two participants, for m-commerce, using collaborative mobile agents called mobile reverse auction agent system (MoRAAS), which mediates between the buyer and the sellers and executes bidding asynchronously and autonomously. This reduces the network load and offers more intelligent bidding. A new double encryption key chain technique and a new RVAP protocol are proposed to achieve unconditional bid privacy. Every losing bidder can control the privacy of their own bids while no trust is needed. Computational cost of our RVAP protocol is reduced by avoiding the costly verifiable encryption technique.}

abstract = {Objective: This post hoc analysis was aimed to summarize the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine as represented by number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) to provide a clinically useful assessment of the position of duloxetine among current agents used to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). Methods: Data were pooled from three 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies in which patients received 60 mg duloxetine either QD or BID or placebo. NNT was calculated based on rates of response (defined as ≥30% and ≥50% reductions from baseline in the weekly mean of the 24-hour average pain severity scores); NNH was calculated based on rates of discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs). Results: Patients receiving duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID had NNTs (95% CI) of 5.2 (3.8-8.3) and 4.9 (3.6-7.6), respectively, based on last observation carried forward; NNTs of 5.3 (3.8-8.3) for 60 mg QD and 5.7 (4.1-9.7) for 60 mg BID were obtained based on baseline observations carried forward. The NNHs (95% CI) based on discontinuation due to AEs were 17.5 (10.2-58.8) in the duloxetine 60-mg QD group and 8.8 (6.3-14.7) in the 60-mg BID group. Conclusion: These post hoc results suggest that duloxetine was effective and well tolerated for the management of DPNP and further support the importance of duloxetine as a treatment option for clinicians and patients to assist with the management of DPNP.}

In these auctions, shippers act as auctioneers who need to outsource a number of transportation services to external carriers. Carriers compete by submitting bids on packages of shippers’ requests. After receiving all carriers’ bids, the shipper solves the well-known winner determination problem (WDP) in order to determine winning bids. This paper considers the WDP in a context where shipment volumes are not known with certainty. Based on the bi-level characteristic of the problem, a 2-stage robust formulation is proposed and solved using a constraint generation algorithm. Experimental results show a good performance of the proposed approach. We also evaluate, through an experimental analysis, the benefits of considering a robust rather than a deterministic WDP.}

abstract = {Background
The risk of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) is higher in Far Eastern population than in Western population, and warfarin use suboptimal. There is uncertainty whether the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) would have a major impact on stroke prevention in Far Eastern populations with AF.
Objectives
We investigated current antithrombotic therapy use on stroke and bleeding risk, determinants of warfarin use and performed a modeling analysis of the net clinical benefit of the NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran) in a large cohort of Chinese patients with AF.
Methods
We studied 1034 Chinese patients (27.1% female, median age 75years, interquartile range [IQR]: 63–83) with AF who were followed-up for an average of 1.9years (IQR: 1.43–2.64). Stroke/thromboembolism (TE), and major bleeding associated to antithrombotic treatment were investigated. A modeling analysis was performed for the net clinical benefit balancing major bleeding against stroke/TE for dabigatran 110mg bid, dabigatran 150mg bid and apixaban, using their respective recent clinical trial outcome data.
Results
Using a Cox proportional hazard model, the Hazard Ratio [HR (95% confidence interval, CI)] for stroke/TE compared to no-antithrombotic therapy (no ATT) was 1.27 (0.65–2.50) on aspirin, 1.40 (0.35–3.57) on clopidogrel, 1.52 (0.72–3.23) on dual antiplatelets and 1.65 (0.76–3.57) on warfarin. The risk for major bleeding was 0.35 (0.14–0.85) on aspirin, 0.74 (0.24–2.29) on clopidogrel, 0.35 (0.11–1.10) on dual antiplatelets, and 0.88 (0.36–2.17) on warfarin. Binary logistic regression analysis showed persistent/permanent AF (Odds Ratio, OR, 2.03 [95%CI 1.05–3.92], p=0.035) was associated with warfarin use, but age ≥75years (0.26 [0.16–0.42], p<0.001), aspirin (0.18 [0.12–0.27], p<0.001) and clopidogrel (0.17 [0.08–0.33], p<0.001) were independent determinants of non-use of warfarin. On modeling net clinical benefit (per 100 person-years [95% CI]), apixaban use compared to antiplatelet agents or no ATT was 3.29 (2.15–4.30) using Singer's method and 2.08 (1.18–3.21) with Connolly's method amongst high-risk patients. The use of dabigatran 110mg bid and 150mg bid compared to antiplatelet agents could reduce an additional 18.1 stroke/TE and 24.3 stroke/TE events, respectively. Compared to warfarin, dabigatran 150mg bid had the best net clinical benefit.
Conclusions
There was suboptimal stroke prevention with no difference between antiplatelet and OAC treated patients, perhaps reflecting an inappropriate Target INR range. On modeling analyses, the use of the NOACs (apixaban and dabigatran) could provide better stroke prevention compared to antiplatelet (or warfarin) use in this Chinese AF population, with a positive net clinical benefit.}

abstract = {Providing efficient layered video streaming to heterogeneous users in varying network conditions requires dynamic bandwidth allocation, efficient data scheduling and incentives. In layered streaming, the video stream is composed of hierarchically encoded sub-stream layers namely the base layer and enhancements layers. We consider a scenario where receiver peers use a pull-based approach to adjust the video quality level to their terminal and network capacities by subscribing to a different number of layers. In this context, in order to take advantage of the available bandwidth in the network and to enhance end users Quality-of-Experience (QoE), we propose a novel approach that efficiently allocates sender peers׳ upload bandwidth to receiver peers. The upstream peer bandwidth is allocated depending on the quality level (requested layers) of the receiver peers, starting by allocating bandwidth for the lower layers first. In order to allocate bandwidth for a certain layer, an auction game is established to distribute the bandwidth among the receiver peers, where the sender peers “sell” their items (upload bandwidth) according to bids submitted by receiver peers. The main goal of this approach is to favor high priority peers while ensuring a minimum quality level to all peers. The proposed bandwidth allocation mechanism is paired with efficient scheduling mechanism for layered streaming. It aims to fully take advantage of the allocated bandwidth while respecting the layers dependency of the stream and the data blocks playback deadline. Extensive evaluations are conducted to compare our proposed algorithm with other bandwidth allocation strategies for layered video streaming. The obtained results show the effectiveness of our model in terms of video quality, useless chunks ratio and bandwidth utilization under different network/streaming conditions.}

Results from these trials are comparable, and slight differences reported can be attributed to specific circumstances at different research sites. rhIGF-I treatment studies of GHI in Ecuador included various trials performed on children belonging to the largest and only homogeneous cohort of subjects with this condition in the world. All trials were performed by the same team of investigators and, during study periods, subjects received similar nutritional, physical activity and medical advice. Combination of these inherent conditions most likely creates less sources of variability during the research process. Indeed, diagnosis, selection and inclusion of research subjects; methodology used; transport, storage and delivery of study drug; data collection, monitoring and auditing; data analysis, discussion of results, conclusion inferences and reporting, etc., were submitted to the same sources of error. For the above-mentioned reasons, we are hereby mainly covering conclusions derived from rhIGF-I treatment studies of Ecuadorian children whit GHRD due to homozygosity of a splice site mutation occurring at GHR gene, whose unaffected parents were both heterozygous for the same mutation. We also describe studies of rhIGF-I administration in adolescent and adult subjects with GHRD, from the same cohort and with the same genetic anomaly.}

Patients received extrafine GB 12.5, 25 or 50 μg twice daily (BID) or placebo for 7 days via pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI), and extrafine BDP/FF via pMDI throughout the study. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of GB plus BDP/FF versus BDP/FF in terms of FEV1 area under the curve from 0 to 12 h (AUC0–12h) on Day 7. Secondary endpoints included: FEV1 AUC0–12h on Day 1; peak FEV1 and FVC on Days 1 and 7; and trough (12 h post-dose) FEV1, FVC and inspiratory capacity (IC) on Days 1 and 7. Of 178 patients randomised (mean age 62.7 years, post-bronchodilator FEV1 48.9%), 172 (96.6%) completed. Mean FEV1 AUC0–12h on Day 7 was significantly higher (p < 0.001) for all GB doses plus BDP/FF compared to BDP/FF alone, with the difference for the 25 and 50 μg BID doses being clinically relevant (i.e., ≥100 mL). The results for the other spirometry endpoints were consistent with the primary endpoint. Adverse events were reported in 7.4, 5.7 and 8.0% of patients receiving GB 12.5, 25 and 50 μg BID, respectively, versus 11.0% of patients receiving BDP/FF alone. This study confirms the value of adding GB to BDP/FF to improve lung function in COPD patients. The dose of extrafine GB 25 μg BID was associated with the best efficacy/safety profile.

Knowing these factors will help to properly set the tender conditions, which can further help to improve how well the bus operator functions, and to reduce public subsidies. The study also aims to estimate the technical efficiency rate by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and find the implications of efficiency scoring for tender conditions. This statistic also enables contract owners to compare the cost differences between individual bus service providers and examine companies that operate at the efficiency frontier.}
