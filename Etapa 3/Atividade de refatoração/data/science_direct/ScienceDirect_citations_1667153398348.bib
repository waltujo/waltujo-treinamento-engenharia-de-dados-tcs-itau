An outcome of this theory is that when data can reasonably be assumed homogeneous in household attributes then the bid-rent model should yield plausible estimates of the willingness-to-pay for each ‘household type’. This paper provides empirical support for this hypothesis using a sample of condominium transactions.}

abstract = {Construction accidents can have major social, financial, reputational and legal implications. Hence, it is to be expected that safety is often presented as a key priority for construction organisations. However, existing evidence suggests that within the construction industry, safety often loses the battle when a trade-off is required with project cost. Improved understanding of the manifestations of the cost and safety interaction are needed. A three-year longitudinal study afforded the opportunity to investigate the safety implications of sub-economic bids on a large infrastructure project in the UK. While low-bidding to win tenders is not new, this paper presents empirical evidence of the consequential safety risk implications of such bidding at the project delivery stage. Faced with a perverse form of the tender ‘Winner’s Curse’ where the successful bid is frequently the lowest, cost-saving strategies are often implemented to recoup lost pricing margins. Our investigation revealed several instances of consequentially elevated safety risks, through cheaper and poor-quality equipment, machinery and temporary structures. In addition, lower-paid migrant workers – who already experience a statistically greater safety risk than local workers – were employed on the project without appropriate investment in a safety management approach suitable for a multinational workforce. The study both contributes to the call to critically rethink the construction industry’s competitive bidding practices, and highlights an industry structure that creates the conditions for high safety risks and accidents.}

These emerging contracting methods place an enormous pressure on the contractors to improve construction quality. For a general contractor, which subcontracts most tasks of a project and invites a number of bids, choosing an appropriate bid which satisfies the time, cost and quality of construction project is complex and challenging. To solve this problem involving conflicting objectives, a fuzzy clustering-based genetic algorithm (FCGA) approach is proposed in this paper. A case study of highway construction is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. A comparative study is conducted over three test cases involving varying dimensions and complexities to test performance of the proposed FCGA against existing approaches. Results reveal that the FCGA is capable of generating better Pareto front than other existing approaches.}

Our model predicts that even a monopolist strategic trader improves market quality and increases liquidator proceeds if trades’ temporary price impacts are quickly reversed, and that competition among strategic traders strictly improves market quality. We provide related empirical evidence by studying prices, liquidity, and individual account trading activity around the large and predictable “roll” trades undertaken by a large exchange-traded fund (ETF). The evidence indicates narrower bid-ask spreads, greater order book depth, and improved resiliency on roll dates. We find that a larger number of individual trading accounts provide liquidity on roll dates, and do not find evidence of the systematic use of predatory strategies. On balance, the theory and evidence imply that traders supply liquidity to rather than exploit predictable trades in resilient markets.}

abstract = {Background
Approximately 20% to 40% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are refractory to standard-dose proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment.
Objective
We compared the efficacy and quality-of-life effects of 20 mg once daily (QD) versus 10 mg twice daily (BID) rabeprazole (RPZ) in patients with refractory GERD-related symptoms and sleep disturbances.
Methods
This multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label study included patients in whom PPI treatment >4 weeks was ineffective. According to the Global Overall Symptom (GOS) scale, PPI-refractory GERD was defined as ≥1 category with >3 points among 10 specific upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Seventy-eight patients were randomly assigned to 20 mg QD and 10 mg BID RPZ groups for 8 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated using self-reported questionnaires, including the GOS scale and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), whereas quality of life was assessed using the Short-Form 8 Health Survey (SF-8), at 4 and 8 weeks. Patients showing improvement at 8 weeks received follow-up every 4 to 8 weeks.
Results
GOS scale scores were significantly improved at 8 weeks in both groups, with no significant intergroup differences. Although SF-8 scores showed an increasing trend over 8 weeks in both groups, the physical component summaries in the 10 mg BID group significantly improved. The mental component summaries clearly improved in the 10 mg BID group. Of the 74 cases (4 missing), 51 (68.9%) had PSQI scores ≥5.5. PSQI scores remained unchanged during follow-up in both groups. The recurrence rate was not significantly different (46.1% vs 47.1% in the 20 mg QD and 10 mg BID groups, respectively) during the follow-up period at median (interquartile range) 24.0 (30.5) months.
Conclusions
In patients with refractory GERD, there was no significant difference in GOS scale score, PSQI, or recurrence rate between the groups. With regard to subscores of the SF-8, the 10 mg BID group might be potentially effective.}

To evaluate differences in body-image distress (BID) scores between women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and controls and whether BID mediates anxiety and depression.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting
Academic institution.
Patient(s)
Reproductive-aged women with PCOS (n = 189) and controls (n = 225).
Intervention
Administering the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations-Appearance Subscale (MBSRQ-AS), Stunkard Figure Rating Scale (FRS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and PCOS quality of life survey (MPCOS-Q).
Main Outcome Measure(s)
BID, depression, and anxiety scores and mediation of depression and anxiety scores by BID.
Result(s)
Women with PCOS had worse BID scores on all five MBSRQ-AS subscales adjusted for age, body mass index, race, pregnancy history, income, and employment, and larger differences on the FRS compared with the control women. In multivariable regression models, the prevalence of depressive (28% vs. 19.2%) and anxiety (76.5% vs. 56.5%) symptoms were also statistically significantly higher in women with PCOS compared with the controls. Most MBSRQ-AS subscale scores statistically significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and quality of life scores. The association between PCOS/control status and higher anxiety and depression scores was completely mediated by the appearance evaluation and body areas satisfaction subscales and partially mediated by overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation, and self-classified weight.
Conclusion(s)
Women with PCOS have increased BID and depressive and anxiety symptoms. In our study different aspects of BID either fully or partially mediated the association between PCOS/control status and depression and anxiety scores, suggesting that therapeutic interventions targeted at improving body image may decrease depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Medida(s) principal(es) de resultado
la BID, las puntuaciones de depresión y de ansiedad y la mediación de las puntuaciones de depresión y de ansiedad con la BID.
Resultado (s)
Las mujeres con PCOS tuvieron peores puntuaciones en la BID y en las cinco subescalas MBSRQ-AS ajustadas por edad, índice de masa corporal, raza, antecedentes gestacionales, ingresos y empleo, y mayores diferencias en el FRS, comparadas con las mujeres control. En los modelos de regresión multivariable, la prevalencia de síntomas depresivos (28% vs 19,2%) y de ansiedad (76,5% vs 56,5%) también fueron estadísticamente significativamente mayores en mujeres con PCOS, comparadas con los controles. La mayoría de las puntuaciones de la subescala MBSRQ-AS se correlacionaron de forma estadísticamente significativa con las puntuaciones de depresión, ansiedad y calidad de vida. La asociación entre el status PCOS/control y las mayores puntuaciones en ansiedad y depresión estuvo completamente mediada con la evaluación de la apariencia y las subescalas de satisfacción de las áreas corporales y parcialmente mediada con la preocupación por el sobrepeso, la orientación de la apariencia y el peso auto-clasificado.
Conclusión(es)
Las mujeres con PCOS tienen aumentados la BID y los síntomas depresivos y de ansiedad. En nuestro estudio, diferentes aspectos de la BID se relacionaron total o parcialmente con la asociación entre status PCOS/control y con las puntuaciones de depresión y de ansiedad, lo que sugiere que las intervenciones terapéuticas dirigidas a mejorar la imagen corporal pueden disminuir los síntomas depresivos y de ansiedad.}

abstract = {Background
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is commonly employed in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC); however, the optimal radiotherapy regimen is still unknown. This 3-institution analysis compares long-term disease control and survival outcomes for once- (QD) versus twice-daily (BID) radiotherapy at contemporary doses.
Methods and Materials
Data were collected for LS-SCLC patients treated with platinum-based CCRT and planned RT doses of >5940 cGy at >180 cGy QD or >4500 cGy at 150 cGy BID. Comparative outcome analyses were performed for treatment groups.
Results
From 2005 through 2014, 132 patients met inclusion criteria for analysis (80 QD, 52 BID). Treatment groups were well-balanced, excepting higher rate of advanced mediastinal staging, longer interval from biopsy to treatment initiation, and lower rate of prophylactic cranial irradiation for the QD group, as well as institutional practice variation. At median survivor follow-up of 33.5 months (range, 4.6–105.8), 80 patients experienced disease failure (44 QD, 36 BID), and 106 died (62 QD, 44 BID). No differences in disease control or survival were demonstrated between treatment groups.
Conclusion
The present analysis did not detect a difference in disease control or survival outcomes for contemporary dose QD versus BID CCRT in LS-SCLC.}

Consistent with studies that suggest that other sources of liquidity withdrew from the markets during the flash crash, we find that the fraction of trades executed by the NYSE increases during this volatile period. Market quality deteriorates following the flash crash as bid-ask spreads increase and quote depths decrease.

abstract = {Environmental monitoring has become an active research area due to the current rise in the global climate change crises. Current environmental monitoring solutions, however, are characterized by high cost of acquisition and complexity of installation; often requiring extensive resources, infrastructure and expertise. It is infeasible to achieve with these solutions, high density in-situ networks such as are required to build refined scale models to facilitate robust monitoring, thus, leaving large gaps within the collected dataset. Low-Cost Sensors (LCS) can offer high-resolution spatiotemporal measurements which could be used to supplement existing dataset from current environmental monitoring solutions. LCS however, require frequent calibration in order to provide accurate and reliable data as they are often affected by environmental conditions when deployed on the field. Calibrating LCS can help to improve their data quality and ensure they are collecting accurate data. Achieving effective calibration, however, requires identifying factors that affect sensor’s data quality for a given measurement. This study evaluates the performance of three Feature Selection (FS) algorithms including Forward Feature Selection (FFS), Backward Elimination (BE) and Exhaustive Feature Selection (EFS) in identifying factors that affect data quality of low-cost IoT sensors in environmental monitoring networks. Applying the concept of data fusion, sensors data were merged with environmental factors and integrated into a single calibration equation to calibrate cairclipO3/NO2 and cairclipNO2 sensors using Linear Regression (LR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The study showed the effectiveness of calibration in improving low-cost IoT sensor data quality and also demonstrated the convenience of feature selection and the ability of data fusion to provide more consistent, accurate and reliable information for calibration models. The analysis showed that the cairclipO3/NO2 sensor provided measurements that have good correlation with reference measurements whereas the cairclipNO2 sensor showed no reasonable correlation with the reference data. Calibrating the cairclipO3/NO2 yielded good improvement in its measurement outputs when compared to reference measurements (R2=0.83). However, calibrating the cairclipNO2 sensor data yielded no significant improvement in its data quality.}

The case study is based on the UK “Quality Contract Scheme”, an option that has never been used before, thus providing an opportunity to understand the challenges in such cooperative schemes, and explore how public authorities struggle to achieve their goals via private service providers. Our findings reveal that the actors could not align their incentives due to transaction costs and information asymmetry, which ultimately damaged the quality of the financial projections and thwarted approval of the scheme.}

Natural scientists provided social scientists with detailed current and future water quality outcomes under proposed nutrient management alternatives.

Results show that Utah households who recreate on Utah's waters (“Users”) are willing to pay up to $13.63 monthly to prevent deterioration of water quality whereas nonusers are willing to pay up to $8.31 per month. Furthermore, Users are willing to pay up to $32 per month to improve water quality in areas that have already been—or are expected to be—degraded by excess nutrients. Our integrated natural science–social science survey design serves as a useful template for similar water quality studies, as well as providing results for benefit transfer by government entities unable to conduct an original benefits analysis as they develop numeric nutrient criteria.}

abstract = {I evaluate the performance of four static sealed-bid package auctions in an experimental setting with complementarities. The valuation model comprises two items and three bidders: two ‘local’ bidders demand one item only, while the third (global) bidder only wants both. The rules I compare include the Vickrey and first-price auctions, the Nearest-Bid Rule and the Reference Rule. Auction-level tests find the first-price auction revenue dominant overall without losing efficiency, while the Vickrey auction performs worst; the other two rules rank intermediate. Bidder-level tests of the experimental data reject the competitive equilibrium bidding functions: overbidding is widespread in all four auctions, and bidders are averse to submitting boundary bids. In core-selecting auctions bidders do not revert to truth-telling rules of thumb. I also observe behavior consistent with collusive bidding in the Vickrey auction. Contrary to theoretical predictions, the Vickrey auction performs worst on efficiency, primarily for this reason. Overall, my results suggest that even in the presence of complementarities, the simple first-price rule may not perform as poorly as feared.}

Objective
This study determines bred heifer auction price response as the number of available bred heifers for purchase decreases while controlling for reproductive management characteristics and feeder cattle prices.
Materials and Methods
The data used in this study came from a bred heifer sale located on the Tennessee and Kentucky state line from 2008 through 2017, and a hedonic pricing model was estimated that considered months pregnant, breed, AI pregnancy, lot size, and timing of when the heifer was purchased in the sale.
Results and Discussion
We found that months pregnant, lot size, sale month, and heifer price affected the sale price of bred heifers. We also can concluded that bred heifer sale price increased until about 49% of all heifers available in the sale were purchased.
Implications and Applications
Beef cattle producers frequently buy and sell cattle through auction markets. However, more information on how timing of placement in the sale affects bred heifer values could be helpful in informing buyers on bid timing to purchase replacements at lower costs. Results suggest that bidding earlier, or waiting to bid later in the sale, could result in lower purchase prices of bred heifer when holding reproductive characteristics and feeder cattle prices constant. This is a unique study that provides insight into bidding timing for buyers to consider when purchasing bred heifers. These strategies could be helpful in selecting lots to bid on that have desired attributes but are being sold when prices are lowest.}

This paper investigates the government’s informal preferences in land allocations in China. Substantial evidence is found that politically connected firms are preferred to win land auctions at lower prices due to two different reasons. These preferences are informally achieved through a two-stage auction mechanism rather than formal bid preference programs, and result in the asymmetrical allocation of urban land in terms of land quality, quantity, and price, across politically and non-politically connected firms in China. The state-owned enterprises are allocated poor quality land parcels at 55% land price discounts. In comparison, the manager-based politically connected firms are allocated regular land parcels at 6% price discounts, and other firms without connections with the government are allocated regular land at higher prices.}

Among the models under analysis we assess the quality of the SH model, developed by the authors in previous work, in relation to other models. The option price in the SH model is affected by the players’ assessments about the behavior of the prices of the underlying asset up to the expiration day and by their “eagerness” levels (i.e., players’ readiness to respond to a given bid proposed by their opponent). We found that for all models, the higher the moneyness, the greater the proximity of models prices to actual market prices and that, eagerness parameters have a decisive effect on tradability. We also found that there was no correlation between the degree of proximity of modeled prices to actual prices and the expected profit gained by players that act according to a given model and that the SH model traded relatively small number of options. The expected profit is highest for the SH model in the ITM and ATM for days that are far from the expiration day.}

abstract = {Purpose
Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF; also known as gastro-resistant DMF) has been reported to have clinical and neuroradiologic efficacy in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in the Phase 3 DEFINE and CONFIRM studies. An integrated analysis of data from DEFINE and CONFIRM was conducted to estimate more precisely the therapeutic effects of delayed-release DMF. Here we describe the impact of RRMS on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at baseline and assess the effects of delayed-release DMF on prespecified HRQoL end points over 2 years.
Methods
Patients with RRMS were randomly assigned to receive delayed-release DMF 240 mg PO BID or TID or matching placebo for up to 2 years (96 weeks). As a tertiary end point in both studies, patient-reported HRQoL was assessed using the Physical and Mental Component Summaries (PCS and MCS, respectively) of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36); global assessment of well-being, as measured on a visual analog scale (VAS); and the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) VAS, administered at baseline and at weeks 24, 48, and 96. Higher scores suggested better HRQoL.
Findings
The integrated analysis included 2301 patients treated with delayed-release DMF BID (n = 769) or TID (n = 761) or placebo (n = 771). The mean PCS and MCS scores at baseline were lower overall compared with those reported in the general US population and were ≥5 points lower (a clinically meaningful difference) in patients with a baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≥2.5 compared with those in patients with a baseline EDSS score of 0. At 2 years, mean PCS and MCS scores were increased from baseline in the patients treated with delayed-release DMF, whereas the mean PCS and MCS scores were decreased from baseline in the placebo group; the difference in PCS and MCS scores was significant for the delayed-release DMF BID and TID groups compared with placebo. SF-36 subscale scores generally remained stable or were improved relative to baseline in patients treated with delayed-release DMF and decreased in patients receiving placebo; improvements were significant for delayed-release DMF BID and TID versus placebo on most subscales. Compared with that in the placebo group, the proportions of patients in the delayed-release DMF groups exhibiting a ≥5-point improvement in SF-36 score were significantly higher. The following factors were found to be predictive of improved PCS and MCS scores at 2 years: delayed-release DMF treatment, lower baseline EDSS score, age ≤40 years (PCS only), and corresponding lower baseline PCS or MCS score. Changes from baseline in VAS and EuroQoL-5D scores were generally consistent with changes in SF-36 scores.
Implications
These HRQoL benefits parallel the improvements in clinical and magnetic resonance imaging end points with delayed-release DMF, suggesting that delayed-release DMF treatment improves patient-perceived health status as well as neurologic and physical functioning.

This is accomplished by isolating three important objectives, namely (maximising) the expected risk-adjusted basic profit, (maximising) the expected risk-adjusted profit corrected for bias in estimating, and (minimising) the expected loss in losing a bid. The “optimum” mark-up is then established by selecting a compromise solution among these three objectives. The procedure is compared with some more conventional (single-criterion) bidding strategies based on actual bidding records. It is shown that a multicriteria decision-making basis is a rational and fundamental way of handling the competitive bidding strategy problem.}

Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of lornoxicam 8 mg BID and diclofenac 50 mg TID in adult Indian patients with OA of the hip or knee. Methods: This 4-week, double-blind, randomized, comparative, multicenter study was undertaken to compare oral lornoxicam and diclofenac in patients with OA. Patients who met the selection criteria were enrolled consecutively from the outpatient clinics of each of the participating hospitals in India. Participants completed the Western Ontario and McMasters Individual Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC-OA), WOMAC Composite Index (WOMAC-CI) (for pain, stiffness, and physical function), and a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) (0–10 where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain or severe or excruciating pain) at each study visit (weeks 0 [baseline], 2, and 4 [or at early termination]). Patients' and physicians' global assessments of arthritis control were measured at each study visit when laboratory and clinical AEs were also monitored. The primary end points were the WOMAC-OA, the WOMAC-CI, and VAS scores for pain among the patients who completed the study. Results: Of the 273 patients (159 men, 114 women; mean [SD] age, 44.73 [10.72] years; range, 28–68 years) enrolled in the study, 13 (7 in the lornoxicam group and 6 in the diclofenac group) were lost to follow-up and their effectiveness and tolerability results were not included in the study analysis. Over the 4-week study period, both drugs provided significant (P < 0.05) sustained relief of OA symptoms compared with baseline. Compared with baseline, the mean pain score (WOMAC-CI) decreased 90.6% (13.88 [4.47] vs 1.30 [1.49]; P < 0.05) in the lornoxicam group and 88.9% (14.15 [4.56] vs 1.57 [1.49]; P < 0.05) in the diclofenac group after 4 weeks of treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, the VAS pain score decreased from baseline 83.1% (8.04 [2.70] vs 1.36 [1.43]; P < 0.05) in the lornoxicam group and 79.3% (7.98 [2.98] vs 1.65 [1.47]; P < 0.05) in the diclofenac group. Compared with baseline, the improvement rated at 2 weeks was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Lornoxicam and diclofenac were well tolerated. The rate of mild to moderate adverse gastrointestinal events was not significantly different in the lornoxicam group compared with the diclofenac group (14.6% vs 18.4%). Similarly, overall tolerability between the 2 groups was not significantly different. None of the patients experienced cardiovascular AEs (eg, edema or increased blood pressure). Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that lornoxicam was comparable to diclofenac in effectiveness and tolerability after 4 weeks of treatment in these adult Indian patients with OA of the hip or knee who completed the study.}

M&A premiums paid are lower in deals involving rated as opposed to nonrated firms. Assuming that the presence of ratings mitigates the problem of information asymmetry and allows bidders to pay a fair price for a target, then the post-M&A performance of bidders of rated targets would be superior. Indeed, we find that the presence of ratings and bidders’ post-M&A operating performance are positively related.}

The qualitative research was conducted by studying eight BIDs in three cities and in three countries - all the BIDs studied had considered or taken actions related to urban freight and sustainability. The results show that BIDs in different countries have similarities and differences in their organisational structure and functions, the main services provided and readiness to promote initiatives related to urban freight improvements. We identified that differences in their accomplishments relate to their motivation, awareness of the scope to influence urban freight and the extent of their collaboration with local and city authorities concerning urban freight initiatives. In general, we suggest that BIDs have the potential to act as important influencers in urban freight as they (i) unite the receivers and encourage them to address joint operations that bring economic and environmental benefits (ii) give the receivers the possibility to implement changes through the power of collective action (iii) facilitate the dialogue and collaboration with local and city authorities. As a result, we suggest that the measures directed to BIDs on improving urban freight can have much more significant return on time and funds invested than if invested in a single businesses and organisations. Our recommendation to BIDs that would like to reach higher level of accomplishments is to ensure stakeholder engagement including engaging and collaboration with local authorities and to demonstrate their willingness to take a lead.}

To protect small-scale actors, citizens’ energy cooperatives were allowed longer realization periods and did not need to have an approval pursuant to the Federal Immission Control Act to submit a bid. Winning cooperatives were given the highest accepted bid, while other participants were paid-as-bid. The aim of this paper is to examine how this auction design affected actor diversity and the risk of winning projects not being realized. Unexpectedly, the outcome of the auctions was that over 90% of the winners were cooperatives, and the average project size of their bids was twice the size of other winning bids. There was also a significant decrease in the highest accepted bid, from 5.78€ct/kWh in the first auction, to 3.82€ct/kWh in the third auction. However, the pricing rule combined with uncertain technology costs and strong competition, may have encouraged overly aggressive bidding. This, as well as cooperatives being exempt from having an approval pursuant to the Federal Immission Control Act, could increase the risk of winning projects not being realized. A conclusion is that special rules for small-scale actors, should be used with caution, especially if they give significant competitive advantages and may affect realization rates.}

We compared the binge eating pathway linking body image dissatisfaction (BID) and psychological distress of obese adults entering and not entering psychological treatment for their weight problems.
Method
90 obese participants seeking an integrated treatment (OB-IT) and 87 obese participants seeking only medical treatment (OB-MT) for their weight problems completed questionnaires on BID, binge eating and psychological well-being.
Results
Only in the OB-IT group, binge eating behaviors mediated the relationship between BID and psychological distress.
Conclusions
Both BID and binge eating behaviors need to be addressed in the psychological and medical treatment for obesity to enhance psychological well-being.}

abstract = {Background
Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) is caused by seasonal allergens and usually manifests as ocular itching and bulbar conjunctival injection (redness). Treatment options for SAC include corticosteroids and dual-acting antihistamine and mast-cell stabilizers.
Objective
Our objective was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of loteprednol etabonate (LE), a C-20 ester-based corticosteroid, with those of olopatadine, a dual-acting antihistamine mast-cell stabilizer, in Chinese patients.
Methods
This was a multicenter, randomized, investigator-masked, parallel group study. Patients with acute SAC experiencing grade 4 ocular itching and grade 2 or higher bulbar conjunctival injection received either LE suspension 0.2% QID at 4-hour intervals or olopatadine solution 0.1% BID at 6- to 8-hour intervals bilaterally for 15 days. Primary efficacy end points included the change from baseline (CFB) in ocular itching and bulbar conjunctival injection at day 15. The primary analysis tested the noninferiority of LE suspension 0.2% to olopatadine solution 0.1%. Tolerability outcomes included the incidence of adverse events (AEs), biomicroscopy findings, visual acuity, and intraocular pressure.
Results
A total of 300 patients were randomly assigned, and 293 were included in the per-protocol population (LE, n = 147; olopatadine, n = 146). Mean (SD) CFB at day 15 in the LE and olopatadine treatment groups, respectively, was −3.74 (0.47) and −3.28 (0.91) for ocular itching and −1.91 (0.52) and −1.71 (0.59) for bulbar conjunctival injection. The 95% CI for the differences in CFB in ocular itching (−0.59 to −0.27) and bulbar conjunctival injection (−0.27 to −0.08) was less than the prespecified noninferiority limit of 0.3. Treatment differences in CFB were significantly better with LE compared with olopatadine for both end points (P ≤ 0.0006). Ocular AEs were few and similar between treatment groups. There were no clinically significant biomicroscopy or visual acuity findings, and no patient experienced a clinically significant increase in intraocular pressure (≥10 mm Hg).
Conclusion
Results of this investigator-masked study with Chinese patients suggest LE suspension 0.2% was noninferior to olopatadine solution 0.1% for the treatment of SAC. Both LE suspension 0.2% and olopatadine solution 0.1% were well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01435460.}

Market quality is reduced during the restrictions, as evidenced by wider bid-ask spreads, increased price volatility and reduced trading activity.

We find that the likelihood of a planned (and completed) minority acquisition relative to a majority or full acquisition is higher if the target operates in a country with poorer government quality, inferior economic freedom, stronger restrictions on international trade, lower financial development, and greater cultural distance with the bidder country. Differences in these institutional attributes between bidder and target countries similarly are informative of bidder acquisition decisions. The results suggest that bidders actively assess cross-country characteristics as part of their acquisition planning, including risk, benefits and acquisition likelihood. The findings provide potential mechanisms for countries to further increase foreign investment through cross-border acquisitions.}

abstract = {Background
Suboptimal compliance in taking guideline-based pharmacotherapy in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) potentially increases the burden of hospitalizations and diminishes quality of life. By simplifying the medical regimen, once-daily dosing can potentially improve compliance. The Compliance And Quality of Life Study Comparing Once-Daily Controlled-Release Carvedilol CR and Twice-Daily Immediate-Release Carvedilol IR in Patients with Heart Failure (CASPER) Trial was designed to measure differential compliance, satisfaction, and quality of life in chronic HF patients taking carvedilol immediate release (IR) twice daily versus the bioequivalent carvedilol controlled-release (CR) once daily.
Methods and Results
CASPER was a prospective multicenter, 3-arm, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial for a 5-month period. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate and compare compliance with carvedilol IR twice daily (BID) and carvedilol phosphate CR once daily (QD) in patients with chronic HF who were taking carvedilol IR. Secondary objectives included comparisons of quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), satisfaction with medication, and brain natriuretic peptide levels between subjects taking the two formulations. A total of 405 patients with chronic HF and left ventricular dysfunction were randomized to: (A) carvedilol IR twice daily, given double blind; (B) carvedilol CR taken in the morning and placebo in the afternoon, given double blind; or (C) carvedilol CR once daily, open label. Compliance was measured using the medication event monitoring system that captures time of bottle opening. The primary end point was a comparison of taking compliance (doses taken divided by total number of prescribed doses over the actual duration of the study) between the double-blind carvedilol IR BID versus the open-label carvedilol CR QD groups. Sample size estimates were based on assumptions of 75% compliance with BID dosing and 90% compliance with QD dosing. Mean compliance with carvedilol IR BID was 89.3% compared with 88.2% for carvedilol CR QD, and differential mean compliance was 1.1% (95% CI –4.4%, 6.6%; ie, not significant). There were no statistically significant differences in compliance between any of the 3 groups, nor differences in quality of life, treatment satisfaction, or physiologic measures among the 3 study arms. There were also no significant differences in adverse events or side effects among patients switching from carvedilol IR to carvedilol CR in arms B or C over the 5-month study duration compared with patients remaining on carvedilol IR.
Conclusions
Compliance among chronic HF patients in the CASPER trial was high at baseline and unaffected by QD versus BID dosing. Over the 5-month follow-up period, there were no differences in adverse events among patients switching from carvedilol IR to CR.}

abstract = {We find evidence that aggregate funding conditions play an instrumental role in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Funding conditions impact the benefits, participants and the number of deals transacted and this impact extends well beyond merger waves. Specifically, when aggregate funding conditions are favorable, the merger market is especially active and small, financially-constrained firms participate heavily. These same firms, however, are largely absent from the deal market when funding conditions are tight. Furthermore, investors view deals during favorable environments as relatively attractive, particularly if the deals are initiated by small bidders. In contrast, deals transacted by large firms during easy-money periods are viewed as value-destroying. We also document that these value-destroying deals are particularly prevalent among large bidders with significant potential for agency costs. Overall, our results suggest that aggregate funding conditions do not merely cause bidders to adjust the scope of their investment decisions consistent with capital rationing, but rather, the changing state of aggregate funding appears to significantly determine the size and composition of the M&A potential bidder pool.}

They typically induce a high concentration of renewable energy plants at very productive sites far-off the main load centres, leading to an inefficient allocation as transmission line capacities are restricted but not considered in the allocation, resulting in an inefficient system configuration in the long run. To counteract these tendencies effectively, we propose a combinatorial auction design that allows to implement regional target capacities, provides a simple pricing rule and maintains a high level of competition between bidders by permitting package bids. By means of extensive numerical experiments we evaluate the combinatorial auction as compared to three further RES auction designs, the current German nationwide auction design, a simple nationwide auction, and regional auctions. We find that if bidders benefit from high enough economies of scale, the combinatorial auction design implements system-optimal target capacities without increasing the average remuneration per kWh as compared to the current German auction design. The prices resulting from the combinatorial auction are linear and anonymous for each region whenever possible, while minimal personalised markups on the linear prices are applied only when necessary. We show that realistic problem sizes can be solved in seconds, even though the problem is computationally hard.}

Arauca exhibited an extremely high level of single-bidder-ratio (96%) and a very low average number of bids submitted per open tendering process (1.05). The paper explores the factors and processes that contributed to explain this outcome. Qualitative and quantitative data was triangulated to address three aspects of the implementation of investment projects in Arauca: (i) transparency in public management; (ii) integrity in public procurement; and, (iii) the adverse effects of the oil-fuelled armed conflict on local democracy and the municipal procurement processes. The paper reports significant shortcomings in the implementation stage of investment projects in Arauca linked with these three components. After three decades of receiving a windfall of oil revenues, Arauca's subnational government was not able to develop strong institutional arrangements to invest the revenues from resource extraction.}

We provide a numerical simulation for a hypothetical agri-environmental scheme (AES) in Italy using FADN data 2011 for the Emilia-Romagna region (E-R). In three implementation scenarios, we compare the Budgetary cost-effectiveness (BCE), the Economic cost-effectiveness (ECE) and Information rent (IR) of the auction with that of two alternative policy instruments (i.e. uniform payment and marginal flat rate payment). Due to the heterogeneity in bidders' opportunity costs, the auction is more cost-effective than a uniform payment in delivering the target outcome. The performance indicators are sensitive to the farmers' expectations about the bid caps, revealing the opportunity of using both competition effect and information leverage associated with the implementation mechanism to increase the auction outcome when the budget is limited.}

High knowledge participants did not value wines differently, but did update bids more with objective information, such as appellation and expert rating, than did low knowledge participants. Both low and high knowledge participants updated their bids significantly after taste-testing the wines. Our findings provide evidence that knowledge and preference are separable, and that knowledge captures a factor giving consumers the ability to process information to form expectations of product quality. Though both low and high knowledge consumers use sensory information, we find differences in preference for wines based on sensory information between low and high knowledge consumers.

The objective of this study was to survey consumers' milk purchasing behavior and investigate the effect of sensory experiences and an educational message on the perceived value of fluid milk at the beginning and near the end of code. Eleven auction sessions were carried out (n = 100 consumers), which included an explanation of the experiment, a survey about demographics and milk purchasing and consumption, sensory evaluation, an educational message, and 3 rounds of nth price auctions. Consumers were blindly served 2 pairs of milk samples from white-pigmented high-density polyethylene [2% and skim milk within 2 to 3 d of production (fresh) and 2% and skim milk with 2 to 3 d until the end of code (near-end)], and asked to indicate their preference and the level of acceptability for each sample using a 7-point hedonic scale. All samples were simultaneously evaluated by a panel of 8 judges who were trained to evaluate milk quality attributes on a 15 cm unstructured line scale. Results from the consumer panel acceptability rating session, trained panel descriptive analysis, and consumer auction bids were analyzed using multivariate factor analysis of variance. Subjecting pre- and post-survey responses to k means cluster analysis revealed 4 bidding populations in each round. Most participants (82%) indicated that they check the code date on milk every time they shop; 77% said they reached for the code date that was farthest out every time. However, on blind tasting, consumers did not prefer fresh over near-end milk. These findings were in agreement with their acceptability scores for fresh 2% (5.0/7.0), near-end 2% (5.2/7.0), fresh skim (4.5/7.0), and near-end skim (4.6/7.0) milks. Trained panelists did not detect a difference in “lacks freshness” flavor in fresh skim (1.9 cm/15.0 cm) or near-end skim milk (1.3 cm). Surprisingly, trained panelists did detect higher “lacks freshness” flavor in 1 lot of fresh 2% (2.3 cm) compared with near-end 2% milk (0.3 cm). When consumers bid on half gallons of milk with visible code dates, fresh skim was valued $0.27 higher than near-end skim, and fresh 2% was valued $0.29 higher than near-end 2%. After blind sensory evaluation, the margin between the fresh and near-end bids decreased to almost zero (fresh skim was valued only $0.03 more than near-end skim; near-end 2% was valued $0.01 more than fresh 2%). After the educational message about the meaning of code dates, consumer bids for near-end ($0.63) and fresh milk ($0.81) decreased compared with the first round of bidding ($0.74 and $1.01, respectively). Additionally, the margin in bids for fresh milk remained numerically higher than those for near-end milk ($0.15 for 2% and $0.21 for skim). The educational message about code date did not have the intended result of increasing consumer value for milk. Although consumers go out of their way to buy the freshest milk, they cannot necessarily distinguish fresh milk from milk at the end of code; consumers appear to value a code date that was farther out more than superior taste, even after a sensory experience and educational message.}

Private bidders experience greater post-acquisition operating performance improvements compared to public bidders. This effect is not due to differences in target types, merger accounting, financing constraints, private equity ownership or subsequent listing of some private bidders, and is robust to instrumentation. Further analysis of governance arrangements at least partially attributes the private bidder effect to lower agency costs in private firms. Not only do private firms pay lower prices for target firm assets, they also operate them more efficiently by containing overhead costs and capital expenditures.}

A System Information Model (SIM), which is an object oriented approach, was retrospectively constructed from the documentation provided to assist the contractor with their tender bid preparation. During the creation of the SIM, a total of 426 errors and omissions were found to be contained within the 77 tender ‘drawing’ documents supplied to the contractor by an Engineering, Construction, Procurement and Management (EPCM). Surprisingly, 70 drawings referenced in the tender documentation, and the Input/Output lists and Cause/Effect drawings were not provided. Yet, the electrical contractor was required by the EPCM organization to provide a lump sum bid and also guarantee the proposed schedule would be met; the financial risks were too high and as a result the contractor decided not to submit a bid. It is suggested that if the original tender documentation had been prepared using a SIM rather than CAD, the quality of information presented to the contractor would have enabled them to submit a competitive bid for the works. The research concludes that the economic performance and productivity of mining projects can be significantly improved by using a SIM to engineer and document electrical instrumentation and control (EIC) systems.}

The paper provides an initial empirical test of the Lerman and Kern modifications, using household level data from Bogota, Colombia. The results of the model are evaluated by comparing forecasted bid-rents to actual rents and forecasted dwelling occupants to actual occupants, by examining the demand prices which emerge from the analysis and by comparing the results to previous housing demand research which uses a hedonic-type approach to analyze identical data. The findings of the study show that the bid-rent model works reasonably well in its predictions and in its estimates of the demand for attributes and, in some ways, it may perform better than a hedonic-type model in forecasting the demand for housing attributes.}

In August 2017, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) established a Working Group (WG) onthe Quality and Use of Global Immunization and Surveillance Data to review the current status and evidence to make recommendations, which were presented to SAGE in October 2019. The WG synthesized evidence from landscape analyses, literature reviews, country case-studies, a data triangulation analysis, as well as surveys of experts. Data quality (DQ) was defined as data that are accurate, precise, relevant, complete, and timely enough for the intended purpose (fit-for-purpose), and data use as the degree to which data are actually used for defined purposes, e.g., immunization programme management, performance monitoring, decision-making. The WG outlined roles and responsibilities for immunization and surveillance DQ and use by programme level. The WG found that while DQ is dependent on quality data collection at health facilities, many interventions have targeted national and subnational levels, or have focused on new technologies, rather than the people and enabling environments required for functional information systems. The WG concluded that sustainable improvements in immunization and surveillance DQ and use will require efforts across the health system — governance, people, tools, and processes, including use of data for continuous quality improvement (CQI) — and that the approaches need to be context-specific, country-owned and driven from the frontline up. At the country level, major efforts are needed to: (1) embed monitoring DQ and use alongside monitoring of immunization and surveillance performance, (2) increase workforce capacity and capability for DQ and use, starting at the facility level, (3) improve the accuracy of immunization programme targets (denominators), (4) enhance use of existing data for tailored programme action (e.g., immunization programme planning, management and policy-change), (5) adopt a data-driven CQI approach as part of health system strengthening, (6) strengthen governance around piloting and implementation of new information and communication technology tools, and (7) improve data sharing and knowledge management across areas and organizations for improved transparency and efficiency. Global and regional partners are requested to support countries in adopting relevant recommendations for their setting and to continue strengthening the reporting and monitoring of immunization and VPD surveillance data through processes periodic needs assessment and revision processes. This summary of the WG’s findings and recommendations can support “data-guided” implementation of the new Immunization Agenda 2030.}

abstract = {Although controversial, antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) appears beneficial in patients with a history of repeated infections, those who have comorbid illnesses, and those with marked airway obstruction. In a community-based, open, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (CIP) 750 mg and clarithromycin (CLA) 500 mg, each given twice daily for 10 days, were compared in 2180 patients with AECB (1083 CIP, 1097 CLA). Patients were > 40 years of age and had complicated/severe AECB episodes defined as at least three episodes within the past year, at least three comorbid conditions, previous failed antibiotic treatment for AECB within the previous 2 to 4 weeks, or community susceptibility data indicating a high number of resistant pathogens. Significant bacterial isolates (105 colony-forming units per milliliter) from homogenized sputa were identified. Susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. The majority of patients were white (83%) and were current or previous smokers (81%). Mean patient age was 62 years. A history of at least three AECB episodes in the previous year was reported by 54% of CIP-treated patients and 53% of CLA-treated patients. Of 777 primary isolates positively identified and cultured from 673 patients, the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included Haemophilus species, 28%; Moraxella catarrhalis, 18%; Enterobacteriaceae, 18%; Staphylococcus aureus, 17%; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 7%; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4%. Beta-lactamase production was found in 38% of Haemophilus influenzae, 10% of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 85% of M catarrhalis isolates. Thirty-four percent of S pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration ≥0.12 mg/L). Among the 673 patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated, clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were 93% and 98% for CIP versus 90% and 96% for CLA. The differences between CIP and CLA did not reach statistical significance. Superinfections were reported significantly more frequently in CLA-treated (3%) versus CIP-treated patients (1%). Eradication rates for specific organisms for CIP and CLA, respectively, were Haemophilus species, 99% and 93%; M catarrhalis, 99% and 100%; S pneumoniae, 91% and 92%; and Enterobacteriaceae, 100% and 95%. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of CIP-treated patients and 10% of CLA-treated patients. CIP 750 mg BID had a higher (but not statistically significant) clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than CLA 500 mg BID in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicated/severe AECB. The causative bacterial pathogens of AECB appear to be evolving, with a predominance of gram-negative and other resistant organisms observed. Thus antibiotic therapy for at-risk patients with AECB should include agents that have activity against gram-negative pathogens.}

abstract = {The rapid adoption of cloud storage and computing services led to unprecedented growth of data centers in the world. As bulk energy consumers, large-scale data centers in the U.S. rack up billions in electricity costs annually. Fortunately, the operational flexibility of data centers can be leveraged to provide valuable frequency regulation services in smart grids to mitigate the indeterminacy of the renewable generation resources. Specifically, this paper aims to leverage computational flexibility provided by servers, such as dynamic voltage frequency scaling and dummy loads. This paper develops a comprehensive framework for data center’s frequency regulation service provision in both hour-ahead market and real-time operations. A risk constrained hour-ahead bidding strategy along with a real-time data center power consumption control algorithm are developed to minimize electricity bills and the total response time of the requests. The introduction of dummy load, realistic bi-linear server power consumption model, and probabilistic forecast of electricity and frequency regulation service prices enable the data center to accurately follow frequency regulation signals, while reducing the financial risks associated with electricity market participation. The simulation results show that the proposed frequency regulation provision framework results not only in significant cost reduction for data centers, but also limits degradation in quality of service. Meanwhile, the stability and reliability of a power grid will be improved by the frequency regulation service provision.}

abstract = {Background
Anticoagulation is recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) to prevent strokes. Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, are associated with numerous practical limitations – frequent anticoagulation monitoring, lifestyle and dietary restrictions – that complicate patient management and may impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study derived HRQoL estimates for AF patients receiving warfarin or dabigatran etexilate (dabigatran), a new oral anticoagulant not requiring anticoagulation monitoring, during one year of stable treatment, i.e. in the absence of outcome events, such as strokes or major bleedings.
Methods
Changes in HRQoL over time and between treatments were assessed using the EQ-5D (utility and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores) at baseline, 3 and 12months in a sub-group of 1435 patients participating in the RE-LY trial. RE-LY was a phase III study that compared the safety and efficacy of warfarin, dabigatran 150mg bid and dabigatran 110mg bid for stroke prevention in patients with AF.
Results
Utilities ranged from 0.805 (dabigatran 150mg bid) to 0.811 (dabigatran 110mg bid) at baseline, and did not change over the one year observation period. No differences between the dabigatran groups and warfarin were statistically significant except for the dabigatran 150mg bid group at 3months. Similarly, none of the within-group or between-group differences in VAS scores were statistically significant.
Conclusions
Over the course of one year, all anticoagulated patients without outcome events (e.g. strokes or major bleedings) had stable HRQoL. Scores between dabigatran and warfarin were comparable, which was unexpected given the known complexities of warfarin treatment.}

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a highly pruritic chronic inflammatory skin disorder. Ruxolitinib, a selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 and Janus kinase 2, potently suppresses cytokine signaling involved in AD pathogenesis.
Objective
We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib (RUX) cream in adults with AD.
Methods
In this phase 2 study (NCT03011892), 307 adult patients with AD, an Investigator’s Global Assessment score of 2 or 3 (mild or moderate), and 3% to 20% affected body surface area were equally randomized for 8 weeks of double-blind treatment to RUX (1.5% twice daily [BID], 1.5% once daily [QD], 0.5% QD, 0.15% QD), vehicle, or triamcinolone cream (0.1% BID for 4 weeks, then vehicle for 4 weeks). Subsequently, patients could apply 1.5% RUX BID for 4 additional weeks of open-label treatment. The primary end point was the comparison between 1.5% RUX cream BID and vehicle in mean percentage change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index at week 4.
Results
All RUX regimens demonstrated therapeutic benefit at week 4; 1.5% BID provided the greatest improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (71.6% vs 15.5%; P < .0001) and Investigator’s Global Assessment responses (38.0% vs 7.7%; P < .001) versus vehicle. Rapid reductions in the itch numerical rating scale score occurred within 36 hours (1.5% BID vs vehicle, ‒1.8 vs ‒0.2; P < .0001) and were sustained through 12 weeks. Patients who transitioned to 1.5% RUX BID improved in all measures. RUX was not associated with clinically significant application-site reactions.
Conclusions
RUX cream provided rapid and sustained improvements in AD symptoms and was well tolerated.}

The concept of scheduling appointment times is directly patterned after current motor carrier industry practice, so that customers can plan for rail or truck deliveries in the same way. A shipment routing problem is decomposed into a deterministic “dynamic car scheduling” (DCS) process for shipments already accepted and a stochastic “train segment pricing” (TSP) process for forecasting future demands which have not yet called in and for which delivery appointments have yet to be scheduled. Both are formulated as multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) problems, where each shipment is treated as a separate commodity. Gain coefficients represent recapture probabilities that a specific customer will accept a carrier’s service offer. A comparison with a widely used revenue management formulation is given. A Lagrangian heuristic for obtaining a primal solution is also described. The problem is solved within a 1% gap using the subgradient algorithm.}

On the demand side, we implement a real money, multi-unit public good auction for these contracts with residents who potentially benefit from reduced water quality risks. The experiments allow us to construct supply and demand curves to find an equilibrium price for water quality improvement.

Production inefficiency characterizes each tenderer. We derive the equilibrium equations and boundary conditions, for which closed-form solutions are not available. We compare the bidding behavior of any pair of rival tenderers and demonstrate that equilibrium prices critically depend on the comparison of the cost difference Δc with respect to the increment of score attribute s. For the same production inefficiency, a tenderer with a relatively higher Δc compared to s, stands in weak competitive position and is forced to bid more aggressively. We show how the opposing advantage of each bidder with respect to cost or score attribute induces the extent of competition. Under a different perspective, we analyze bidding by a pair of tenderers for a given maximum score, achieved when pricing is at cost. Our analysis reveals that the player with consistently higher percentage change of the probability of being more efficient than the rival, is in a disadvantageous position and receives lower score in the awarding process. Our results are useful for tenderers in assessing their competitive position. The findings enable contracting authorities to evaluate competition at the preliminary stage of design and to examine the effects of the awarding criterion on pricing.}

abstract = {We highlight the importance of reducing the perceived risk associated with information asymmetry for experience goods. We analyse a major online non-perishable experience good, wine, from the seller's perspective. The mechanism for lowering information asymmetry is the verification service offered by the auctioneer. By focusing on unsold items/lots, the wine and auction characteristics affecting the probability of a sale are identified. Results show that the verification of the wine's provenance increases the probability of sale by 5.7 percent and leads to an expected increase of 5.1 percent in the auction price. When both effects are combined, the increase in the expected revenue of the seller is 7.3 percent. We test and find no evidence of selection bias. Given the heterogeneity in wine prices, a quantile regression analysis shows how the results differ for high-priced wines compared to lower priced wines. Results highlight how the mechanisms to lower the degree of information asymmetry work both in attracting bidders to online auctions and encouraging bidders to submit higher bids.}

Within the ESPRIT project “bidprep” (No. 7131) enterprises, research institutes and a software vendor cooperate in order to develop a generally applicable solution. In order to coordinate the distributed work, a modularization concept has to be followed. The system architecture follows object-oriented principles. As its distribution mechanism, the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (corba) has been chosen. corba provides a high-level protocol for object distribution and communication that allows a precise module interface specification. The gained experiences and its benefits are described.}

abstract = {The Polish 4G spectrum auction was a watershed event for the Polish telecommunications market. For the first time in history, the Office of Electronic Communications decided to award spectrum by using an auction process. Polish regulators implemented a simultaneous multiple-round ascending-bid auction, which was widely used worldwide for selling spectrum. The process leading to the auction and the auction itself was lengthy and eventful. Due to the wrong auction design, the auction dragged on indefinitely, causing a delay in spectrum distribution. The auction ended only as a result of the government's intervention, after 8 months (513 rounds) of bidding that raised revenue of over PLN 9 billion (over EUR 2 billion). This paper describes in detail the rules of the Polish 4G auction, analyses bidding behaviour and auction dynamics of the crucial phases of auctions, and presents the final outcomes. It also draws lessons that could help policy makers in Poland and other countries in auction design.}

After confirming the agency-based predictions of the outcome model of dividends within the context of our sample, we show that the dividend-paying statuses of bidders and targets affect the method of payment, the bid premium, and the future dividend policy of the combined entity in cross-border deals, and that the effects are often different from the previous findings in the U.S. deals. Our paper also shows that the firm-level dividend policy status of bidders and targets provides insight on M&A characteristics beyond those identified in prior studies using only differences in country-level governance measures.}

Using this method, we study the problem of quality manipulation: the quality evaluating agent may exaggerate the quality score of a favored firm in exchange for a bribe. We propose a test for quality manipulation and perform it on the server room procurement dataset. We find that the bidding behaviors are generally consistent with the competitive model but not the corruption model.}

However, in firms with a high ownership concentration investors tend to increase the bid–ask spreads and trade less. The results show us how the governance rules exert influence on the proxies of information asymmetry in the market. The failure to find the relationship between voluntary disclosure of information and the turnover ratio shows us that the liquidity of shares is more related to the greater or lesser concentration of shareholders, with the performance of their companies than with the access to information. Moreover, it is clear that the role that information disclosure plays in these markets is mainly at the level of price formation.}

Relative to non-hagglers (# bids ≤2), hagglers who employ a constant bid increment (i.e., a linear) strategy and a decreasing bid increment (i.e., concave) strategy save more, while those who employ an increasing bid increment strategy (i.e., convex) fare no better. A post hoc analysis also shows that hagglers place many bids in the pursuit of higher quality products, while non-hagglers save friction costs by sacrificing quality (e.g., targeting lower star hotels and adjusting the days of travel).}

This WTP study is based on an actual investment project that was under serious consideration by the government and is based on the multiple-bounded discrete choice (MBDC) approach, which explicitly recognizes the potential uncertainties involved in the study. The potential ordering effects associated with the MBDC approach are empirically tested, and the results indicate that although the presentation order of the polychotomous likelihood choices may not have a significant impact on the WTP estimation, the presentation order of bid levels may have a significant impact.}

This can be achieved through data mining (DM) which is seen as a form of technological advancement that aids decision making through the analysis of data from the large sea of available data. This approach has been adopted in different fields in countries around the world and appreciable results have been recorded. This study, through the review of related literature explored the concept of DM and how it can be beneficial in increasing performance within the Nigerian Construction Industry (NCI). The study discovers that the use of DM can be highly useful to the NCI as lessons learnt from projects can be transferred to others in a bid to achieve successful project delivery. The study, therefore, recommends the use of DM within the NCI as a truly beneficial tool in achieving successful and sustainable project delivery.}

First, we use the Glosten (1994) model for an electronic order-driven market. In line with theoretical predictions, the price impact increases with trade size, and is estimated between 25% (for small transactions) and 60% (for large transactions) of the total spread. We then use a reduced form approach based on a multi-period Vector Auto Regression. The VAR estimates of the permanent price impact are between 40% and 115% of the spread, much larger than the estimates of Glosten's one-period model. We check the robustness of these results by less restrictive, direct estimates of long-run price effects and confirm the results of the VAR analysis. We separately analyze the price effects of off-exchange transactions. These appear to have no long run price impact at all. In all results, there is no reversal of the direction of trade, which suggests that inventory control is unlikely to be important on the Paris Bourse.}

Our study has important implications for the regulation of HFT; we provide recommendations for regulators in relation to market rules which have yet to be introduced, using an artificial market framework. This paper addresses the question of whether this tax leads to a reduction in HFT activities and, as a result, to deterioration or amelioration of market quality. The evidence we provide should help market regulators to better understand the role played by HFT firms as liquidity suppliers. We show that HFT liquidity is short-lived. With the implementation of tax, decreased HFT activities do not have a statistically significant impact on market volatility and market liquidity measured by bid/ask spreads, but decrease dollar volumes as a liquidity measure. In addition, reduced HFT activities lead to less efficient markets as the deviation from fundamentals increases.}

A new parboiler was introduced to improve the milling yield and intrinsic quality of local rice. We conducted Vickrey second price auctions to elicit rural Beninese consumers’ willingness to pay for rice obtained through the new parboiler and two locally innovated parboilers. The individual auctions were followed by a group discussion during which consensus was reached on socially acceptable prices. Relative to traditionally parboiled rice, consumers were willing to pay price premiums of 9–13% for rice obtained through a local parboiler using a container of which the bottom is a perforated metal, 27% for rice obtained through a local parboiler using wooden sticks at the bottom of the pot, and 25–34% for rice parboiled through the improved parboiler. Bids were influenced by the presentation order of the products according to perceived quality. Bids were also higher when participants had been informed on the benefits of improved parboiling techniques, which is a crucial insight for developing marketing and communication strategies for this improved quality product. Group bids were not significantly different from individual bids which suggests that the latter are within the range of socially acceptable prices defined through group consensus.}

The paper then provides empirical tests of the proposition that the variance related bias exhibited by the Black-Scholes model is due to this misestimation of volatility. The results indicate that although the misestimation is systematically related to the variance, it is not of sufficient magnitude to explain the volatility bias exhibited by Black-Scholes model.}

abstract = {Purpose
Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Expert Consensus Guidelines recommend topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as first-line medications for osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain, but several voluminous daily applications are required to achieve efficacy. There is a need to develop new and improved topical analgesics with a faster onset, longer duration of action, and the requirement to apply less gel. This trial investigated the safety and efficacy of a new 3.06% diclofenac gel (AMZ001) in subjects with knee OA.
Methods
In total, 444 subjects (AMZ001 twice daily (BID) [n = 121], AMZ001 once daily (QD) + placebo QD [n = 121], placebo BID [n = 121], or Voltaren 1% 4-times daily [n = 81]) were enrolled. All except Voltaren 1% (single-blinded) were applied topically in a double-blind manner for a total of 4-weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 4 in the WOMAC pain sub-score in the target knee. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included additional efficacy measures (WOMAC total score, WOMAC function and stiffness sub-scores, WOMAC pain weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing sub-scores, ICOAP, chair-stand test, OMERACT-OARSI responder rate, PGA, WPAI, EQ-5D, rescue medication use, satisfaction questionnaire) and safety.

Treatment with AMZ001 QD was effective at reducing WOMAC pain sub-scores vs placebo (estimated treatment difference [ETD]: −4.61 [95% confidence interval (CI): −9.09, −0.12]; p = 0.0440); however, BID application was not (ETD: −3.76 [95% CI: −8.21, 0.68]; p = 0.0969). For several secondary endpoints, changes from baseline to week 4 conferred nominally statistically significant improvements in favor of AMZ001 vs placebo, including PGA score (AMZ001 BID vs placebo, ETD: −0.61 [95% CI: −1.11, −0.11]; p = 0.0162; AMZ001 QD vs placebo, ETD: −0.63 [95% CI: −1.13, −0.13]; p = 0.0134), WPAI overall work impairment score (AMZ001 QD vs placebo, ETD: −10.44 [95% CI: −20.84, −0.04]; p = 0.0492), and EQ-5D VAS score (AMZ001 BID vs placebo, ETD: 4.70 [95% CI: 0.55, 8.85]; p = 0.0264). Post-hoc analysis excluding 11–14 subjects per group with pain scores that decreased between screening and baseline suggests a consistent effect of both AMZ001 QD (ETD: −5.84 [95% CI: −10.71, −0.97]; p = 0.0189) and BID (ETD: −5.35 [95% CI: −10.16, −0.54]; p = 0.0292) in reducing WOMAC pain sub-scores vs placebo. In general, treatment satisfaction was high, as measured by the satisfaction questionnaire. The frequency and incidence of adverse events (AEs) was greatest in the placebo group. Most AEs (>99%) were of mild or moderate severity. There were no serious AEs. There were no notable effects of any treatment on vital signs, ECGs, physical examination findings, or other laboratory assessments.
Conclusions
Treatment with AMZ001 BID for 4 weeks improved WOMAC pain sub-scores; however, only QD application conferred nominally statistically significant improvements vs placebo. AMZ001 was generally well tolerated.}

Potential sellers know the number of bidders remaining from the last house sale. If two or more bidders remain, the seller obtains the gains to trade through competitive bidding. The market is active. With one monopolistic bidder, the buyer captures the surplus and sellers become unwilling to enter. The market remains inactive until sellers think enough time has passed for buyer entry to have replenished the market and make entry profitable. The resulting pattern of trade matches up with observations from Dane County, Wisconsin.}

Shenfu injection (SFI) is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine widely used in the treatment of septic shock in China.
Aims
The aims of this study are to investigate the protective effects of SFI on sepsis-induced myocardial injury in mice and to identify the underlying mechanism of action.
Materials and methods
Seventy-two male C57/B6J mice (5–6 weeks old) were randomly divided into five groups: control (NC), sham sepsis (sham), sepsis (Lipopolysaccharide- LPS), sepsis treated with a low dose SFI, and sepsis treated with a high dose SFI. Sepsis was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Myocardial tissue samples were collected from different groups at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h post-LPS injection. Myocardial injury was examined using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and TUNEL staining. Western-blot analysis was performed to determine the protein expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (Bid), truncated-Bid (t-Bid) and caspase-9 in all the groups. Moreover, the structural changes in the mitochondria of cardiomyocytes were also observed by transmission electron microscopy.
Results
H&E staining revealed structural damage, local necrosis, interstitial edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and vacuolar changes in the myocardial tissue in the sepsis (LPS) group; almost intact myocardial tissue was observed in the high dose SFI group with improvements in interstitial edema and inflammatory cell infiltration. We observed that LPS-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was significantly improved with high dose SFI as compared with sepsis (LPS) group (P ˂ 0.05). LPS was found to decrease the protein expression of Bcl-2 and increase the level of Bid, t-Bid and caspase-9. Treatment with SFI significantly increased the Bcl-2 protein expression (P ˂ 0.05) and decreased the protein expression of Bid, t-Bid and caspase-9 as compared with LPS group (P ˂ 0.05). Markedly swollen myocardial mitochondria with partial vacuolation were observed in LPS treated mice while SFI treatment was found to significantly improve the LPS-induced morphological damage of the mitochondria.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrate that SFI protects against sepsis-induced myocardial injury in mice through the suppression of myocardial apoptosis. It upregulates the protein expression of Bcl-2 and downregulates the protein expression of Bid, t-Bid and caspase-9, and alleviates sepsis-induced mitochondrial damage.}

In this comment I show theoretically that the survey fielded by Desvousges et al. (2015) is missing important features necessary for the conduct of an adding-up test. Next, I describe how the CVM data collected by Desvousges et al. (2015) suffers from non-monotonicity, flat bid curve and fat tails problems, each of which will cause willingness-to-pay estimates and standard errors to be sensitive to the approach chosen to measure the central tendency. Using additional parametric approaches that are standard in the CVM literature, I find that willingness-to-pay for the whole is not statistically different from the sum of the parts in two of three additional estimates. In other words, the data passes the adding-up test. The negative result in Desvousges et al. (2015) is not robust to these alternative approaches to willingness-to-pay estimation. The primary reason is low data quality.}

For the trading of used goods as well as new ones, this study proposes a periodic double auction model for Internet-based electronic markets whereby each bidder can place both asks and bids for selling and purchasing goods respectively during a trading period. The proposed model allows each bidder to place a spending limit order such that the difference between the cost of the purchased goods and the income obtained from the sold goods does not exceed this limit. Furthermore, since a bidder may be indifferent to multiple goods, e.g. copies of a same title, the model also provides a mechanism so that bidders may combine a number of bids inside a set and put a limit on the number of goods to be purchased in this set. The model is mathematically defined, and the corresponding winner determination problem is formulated using linear integer programming. Since the problem is shown to be NP-hard, a number of heuristic methods are also proposed. Performances of these methods are evaluated on a comprehensive test suite and statistical analyses of the results are presented. Furthermore, possible economical contribution of the model is also evaluated. The results indicate that the proposed model can be used efficiently in large-scale markets with tens of thousands of bidders.}

abstract = {Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) applications take advantage of the ubiquity and sensing power of smartphones in data gathering. Designing an incentive mechanism for motivating individuals to participate in such systems is vital. Reverse Auction (RA) is a popular framework in which first, the participants bid their expected returns, and then, the task creator selects a subset of them with a view to maximise the cumulative contribution within a prescribed budget. In RA, the participants are not aware of their winning probability before the auction is closed. If the participants are given some statistical information about the returns associated with their bid and contribution, they may reduce their bid and/or increase their contribution in order to increase their returns. In this paper, we propose Modified Reverse Auction (MRA) wherein, before the auction is closed, the winning probability of the participants are estimated and revealed individually, and then they are allowed to improve their winning probability by reducing their bid and/or increasing their contribution via moving to a different location. We also propose a tool called action evaluator which helps the participants to find their most profitable bid and/or location within certain specified limits. We also propose an enhancement called MRA with Profit Booster (MRA-PB), which employs a profit booster strategy to not only improve the profit of the participants who are amenable to following the recommendation of the action evaluator, but also to increase the total contribution, which benefits the task creator. Through conducting extensive experiments, we show that in comparison to RA, the MRA not only benefits the task creator by increasing the return on investment (i.e., the total contribution for the same budget), but also increases the total received rewards of the participants who follow the recommendation of the action evaluator during the auction.}

Induction chemoradiotherapy plus surgery remains an option to study in IIIA(N2) and selected IIIB NSCLC. Here we report ten-year long-term survival of a prospective multicenter German–French phase-II trial with trimodality.
Patients and methods
Mediastinoscopically proven IIIA(N2)/selected IIIB NSCLC received three cycles cisplatin (50mg/m2 day 1+8) and paclitaxel (175mg/m2d1) qd 22. Concurrent CTx/RTx followed: 45Gy (1.5Gy bid) with cisplatin 50mg/m2 day 2+9 and etoposide 100mg/m2 d 4–6. Surgery was planned three to five weeks after RTx. If evaluated inoperable/irresectable at the end of RTx, definitive RTx-boost (20Gy; 2Gy qd) followed. Here we report 10-year-LTS for this cohort.
Results
All 64 patients were accrued 3/99 to 2/02. Patients characteristics: IIIA(N2)/IIIB 25/39; m/f 48/16; adeno/squamous/large-cell/adenosquamous/NOS 15/26/18/3/2; age: median 52.5 (range 33–69). 36 operated: R0 32/36 (89%); pCR 16/36 (44%). 10-year-LTS%; all 26.0; IIIA(N2) 37.1; IIIB 17.9; relevant prognostic factors (exploratory): pretreatment – histopathology (squamous/adeno) – age (<50/≥50) – Charlson-CI: 1/>1 – BMI (≥25/<25) – pack years smoking (≥10/<10); treatment-dependent – R0/no-R0.
Conclusions
This regimen achieves substantial LTS. Interestingly, adenocarcinomas, older patients, unfavorable comorbidity scores, higher BMI and light smokers demonstrate poor long-term outcome even with aggressive trimodality. This dataset defines the rationale for our ongoing randomized trial with surgery after induction therapy in IIIA(N2)/selected IIIB (ESPATÜ).}

Empirical evidence from this research indicates that pseudo market-makers prefer lower-price stocks post-reduction, as the yield from quoting these spreads are higher. This is accompanied by a corresponding shift in trading activities, away from higher priced securities. Trading costs, measured using simulated market impact, decrease for large trades in the top price tier but increase otherwise.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study was to compare two welfare outcome measures, willingness to pay (WTP) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, to measure outcomes in stuttering.
Method
Seventy-eight adult participants (74 nonstuttering and 4 persons with stuttering) completed one face-to-face structured interview regarding how much they would be willing to pay to alleviate severe stuttering in three interventions of varying impact. These data were compared with QALYs gained as calculated from time trade off (TTO) and standard gamble (SG) data.
Results
Mean (median) WTP bids ranged from US$ 16,875 (8000), for an intervention resulting in improvement from severe stuttering to mild stuttering, to US$ 41,844 (10,000) for an intervention resulting in a cure of severe stuttering. These data were consistent with mean changes in QALYs for the same stuttering interventions ranging from 2.19 (using SG) to 18.42 (using TTO).
Conclusions
This study presents the first published WTP and QALY data for stuttering. Results were consistent with previous cost-of-illness data for stuttering. Both WTP and QALY measures were able to quantify the reduction in quality of life that occurs in stuttering, and both can be used to compare the gains that might be achieved by different interventions. It is widely believed that stuttering can cause reduced quality of life for some speakers; the introduction into this field of standardized metrics for measuring quality of life is a necessary step for transparently weighing the costs and consequences of stuttering interventions in economic analyses. Educational objectives: The reader will be able to (a) describe the underlying theoretical foundations for willingness to pay and quality adjusted life years, (b) describe the application of willingness to pay and quality adjusted life years for use in economic analyses, (c) compare and contrast the value of willingness to pay and quality adjusted life years in measuring the impact of stuttering treatment on quality of life, (d) interpret quality adjusted life years, and (e) interpret willingness to pay data.}
