abstract = {Objectives
To elicit a willingness-to-pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimate for the general Greek population and assess the impact of individuals' socio-demographic characteristics and motives on this estimate.
Methods
A telephone-based survey was carried out employing a representative sample of the general Greek population (n = 1342). A computer-assisted telephone-interview method was adopted to ensure random sampling. A total of 528 participants reported a WTP value for a utility improvement from their current health to perfect health. Those individuals’ motives were assessed through predefined statements. Test–retest reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Multiple linear regression (MLR) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were conducted to assess the effect of socioeconomic/demographic determinants and motive statements, respectively, on WTP/QALY. MLR was re-estimated considering as dependent variable the WTP/QALY estimate calculated for participants: (1) stating a WTP value ≤ their household income and (2) presenting higher certainty regarding stated WTP value (sensitivity analysis).
Results
Analysis revealed good reliability for WTP/QALY estimates and motive statements (ICC values > 0.8). Mean WTP/QALY was €26 280. The respective 5% trimmed value was €14 862. Being a student and household income affected WTP/QALY. Sensitivity analysis did not produce markedly different WTP/QALY predictors, implying the robustness of results, irrespective of the participant group considered. Individuals who indicated the inability to cover basic family needs or pay tax claims as motives reported lower WTP/QALY values compared with those not viewing these aspects as motives.
Conclusions
Findings confirm that the World Health Organization’s criterion used currently in Greek cost-effectiveness studies is not unreasonable. Additional research is essential to further explore WTP/QALY estimates in the Greek setting and facilitate informed decision making.}

Some patients receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for the first-line treatment of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) experience intolerable adverse events. Management strategies include dose adjustments, interrupting or discontinuing therapy, or switching to an alternative TKI.
Methods
This multicenter, single-arm, Phase IIIb study included CML-CP patients intolerant of, but responsive to, first-line treatment with imatinib or dasatinib. All patients were switched to nilotinib 300 mg bid for up to 24 months. The primary endpoint was achievement of MR4.5 (BCR-ABL transcript level of ≤0.0032% on the International Scale) by 24 months.
Results
Twenty patients were enrolled in the study (16 imatinib-intolerant, 4 dasatinib-intolerant); which was halted early because of low recruitment. After the switch to nilotinib 300 mg bid, MR4.5 at any time point up to month 24 was achieved in 10 of 20 patients (50%) in the full analysis set. Of the non-hematological adverse events associated with intolerance to prior imatinib or dasatinib, 74% resolved within 12 weeks of switching to nilotinib 300 mg bid.
Conclusion
Nilotinib 300 mg bid shows minimal cross intolerance in patients with CML-CP who have prior toxicities to other TKIs and can lead to deep molecular responses.}

Bidders coordinated their bids to form valid corridors and compete with other valid corridors to be successful. We tested the impact of bidding flexibility in terms of (a) bidders differentiating their offers for different eligible corridors and (b) bidders submitting a single offer that would automatically be considered for all eligible corridors. Within the bidding options, we compared the performance of the auctions under a net benefit and a benefit cost ratio selection criteria. We found that participants conditioned their offers in terms of corridor benefit information. As a consequence, allowing multiple offers significantly increased payment and rent extraction. On the other hand, a single offer restriction facilitated a higher proportion of valid agreements and reduced rent extraction and, as a result, the agency's payment. We could not find any significant difference between project selection criteria in terms of payment and rent extraction. These results provide important insights for policy makers engaged in conservation market design throughout the world.}

abstract = {Background
The prolonged-release once-daily (QD) tacrolimus is a formulation developed to improve adherence to immunosuppressant (IS) regimen, reducing the frequency of dosing, and to increase safety, avoiding toxic peak concentrations. We evaluated efficiency and quality of conversion from twice-daily (BID) to QD tacrolimus formulation in stable liver transplant (LT) recipients in the real-setting of a gastrohepatology team peripheral to LT centers.
Patients and methods
Thirty-four LT recipients (median age 60 years, range 33–69) were switched from BID tacrolimus to QD tacrolimus (1:1 dose) at a median of 38 months (range 8–211) after transplantation. Tacrolimus levels and laboratory analyses were recorded before and postconversion. Adherence to IS treatment was measured by a modified “Basel Assessment of Adherence Scale to Immunosuppressives.”
Results
Median postconversion follow-up was 21 months (range 6–35, at least 12 months in 30 patients). Mean total tacrolimus daily dose and mean tacrolimus trough level were not significantly different before and after the switch (3.1 ± 2.3 preconversion versus 3.1 ± 2.5 and 3.0 ± 2.5 mg at 6 and 12 months postconversion, respectively; and 5.3 ± 1.8 preconversion versus 4.6 ± 1.4 and 4.5 ± 1.8 ng/mL at 6 and 12 months postconversion, respectively). All patients maintained stable liver and metabolic parameters. Renal function by glomerular filtration rate increased (67 ± 17 preconversion versus 73 ± 19 and 73 ± 20 mL/min at 6 and 12 months postconversion, respectively; P = .003). No acute rejection episode or major severe adverse events occurred postconversion. Patient-reported outcome showed a reduction of missed IS doses.
Conclusion
We observed that in a real-world setting far from LT centers, the switch from BID tacrolimus to QD tacrolimus in stable LT recipients is efficient (safe and effective) to improve quality of medical care, with possibly better IS adherence and improvement of renal function.}

abstract = {Background
The Fontan operation results in a circulation that is dependent on low pulmonary vascular resistance to maintain an adequate cardiac output. Medical therapies that lower pulmonary vascular resistance may augment cardiac output and improve long-term outcomes.
Objectives
This phase I/II clinical trial conducted by the Pediatric Heart Network was designed to evaluate short-term safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of udenafil in adolescents following Fontan.
Methods
A 5-day dose-escalation trial was conducted in five study cohorts of six subjects each (37.5, 87.5, and 125 mg daily, 37.5 and 87.5 mg by mouth twice daily). A control cohort with 6 subjects underwent exercise testing only. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded, PK samples were collected on study days six through eight, and clinical testing was performed at baseline and day five.
Results
The trial enrolled 36 subjects; mean age 15.8 years (58% male). There were no significant differences in subject characteristics between cohorts. No drug-related serious AEs were reported during the study period; 24 subjects had AEs possibly or probably related to study drug. Headache was the most common AE, occurring in 20 of 30 subjects. The 87.5 mg bid cohort was well tolerated, achieved the highest maximal concentration (506 ng/mL) and the highest average concentration over the dosing interval (279 ng/mL), and was associated with a suggestion of improvement in myocardial performance. Exercise performance did not improve in any of the dosing cohorts.
Conclusions
Udenafil was well-tolerated at all dosing levels. The 87.5 mg bid cohort achieved the highest plasma drug level and was associated with a suggestion of improvement in myocardial performance. These data suggest that the 87.5 mg bid regimen may be the most appropriate for a Phase III clinical trial.}

We use a high-frequency-based noise variance estimator as the comprehensive proxy for market quality and find that volatility asymmetry is closely related to market quality. Specifically, in the period of poor market quality, the volatility asymmetry will vanish or even be reversed, which is mainly due to the sharp decline of the leverage effects. Moreover, the volatility feedback effect will be enhanced while the leverage effect will be weakened if the noise variance is taken into consideration in the causal analysis. Finally, we use other market quality indices as auxiliary variables in the robustness analysis and get similar results.}

However, it remains unclear how consumers arrive at their valuation of food quality attributes. This study examined the determinants of actual behavior to upgrade to safety- and hygiene-enhanced fresh produce. More specifically, the integrative model of behavioral prediction was adapted with internal factors to identify determinants of real payments elicited with the Becker–DeGroot–Marschak mechanism. A field experiment (n=147) was conducted with consumers of kale (Brassica oleracea) at a traditional peri-urban market in Nairobi, Kenya. Partial least squares path modeling and censored quantile regression analysis were used to detect different structural relationships between the set of the determinants and real payments along the range of auction prices. The results show that among consumers with low valuations, payments were reduced by salience, but increased by social anxiety and trust. In addition, trust helped to increase payments around the median bids. Among consumers with higher valuations, payments were increased by salience. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating a non-linear setting when analyzing the influence of salience and social evaluation on auction bids. These asymmetrical structural relationships have important implications for the design and validity of monetary valuations and field auction experiments involving measurement of real payments for food product attributes.}

The proposed method can identify inconsistency in iterative responses at each bid interval. We apply this method to data from five well-known double-bounded contingent valuation surveys. The predictions of our model match closely with parametric outcomes. Further, we find that the inconsistency patterns generally vary for different data sets and different bid intervals within data sets. Therefore no single behavioral model can explain all latent inconsistency patterns either within or across data sets. In addition, we examine the impact of inconsistency in responses on bias and efficiency of the double-bounded format in the absence of correction for inconsistency. We conclude that the commonly cited benefits of the double-bounded format hold only in the special case of nearly perfect consistency between initial and follow-up response distributions. Our method provides a simple tool researchers can use to determine the similarity in response distributions between the initial and follow-up responses and whether incorporating collected follow-up responses are likely to actually increase efficiency without introducing bias.}

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the impact on Quality of Life (QoL) of postconsolidation immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). PATIENTS & METHODS: A multi-national randomized open-label phase 3 trial recruited 320 AML patients between 1998 and 2000. Patients were enrolled after termination of consolidation therapy, stratified by country and remission status (first or subsequent remission), and randomized to HDC/IL-2 treatment or no treatment (standard-of-care, control). The treatment was self-administered at home and included ten 3-week courses of HDC (0.5 mg sc bid; EpiCept Corporation) plus low-dose recombinant IL-2 (aldesleukin, 18,000 U/kg sc bid; Chiron Corp). Cycles 1–3 comprised 3 wks of treatment followed by 3 wks of rest, whereas in cycles 4–10 the rest periods were 6 wks. As reported previously (Blood 2006; 108:88), the trial met the primary endpoint of prolonged leukemia-free survival (LFS) for all patients randomized (P=0.008). Assessment of QoL, a secondary trial endpoint, was performed using the validated EORTC-C30(v2) instrument at 8 pre-defined study visits: baseline; pre- and post-cycles 3, 5, and 8; and at 18 months. Data were analyzed as specified in the EORTC scoring manual for 9 scales (1 global, 5 functional, 3 symptom scales) and 6 single-symptom items. Comparisons were made between and within groups at 1.baseline vs. each visit,2.pre- vs. post-treatment, and3.baseline vs. end of treatment (18 months). RESULTS: At least one questionnaire was completed by 285 patients (89%). Patients in both study arms increased or maintained QoL status from baseline to last evaluation with respect to global health status, physical, cognitive and role functioning, and financial issues, as well as symptoms of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, diarrhea, and dyspnea. Comparisons of pre- vs. post-treatment QoL assessments showed transient increases in fatigue (P=0.008), nausea/vomiting (P=0.006), and appetite loss (P=0.005) in the treatment arm. CONCLUSION: Post-consolidation immunotherapy with HDC/IL-2 self-administered at home by AML patients was associated with transient gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue, but did not prevent recovery from induction/consolidation chemotherapy.}

Formoterol is a long-acting β2-agonist with a rapid onset of effect in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), making it potentially suitable for both maintenance and as-needed bronchodilator treatment. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of maintenance formoterol in patients with COPD and to compare the effects of additional formoterol as needed with terbutaline. In this 6-month, double-blind study, 657 patients with COPD (⩾40 years, forced expiratory volume in 1s [FEV1] 40–70% predicted normal) were randomized to formoterol 9μg twice daily (bid) plus terbutaline 0.5mg as needed (FORM bid), formoterol 9μg bid plus formoterol 4.5μg as needed (FORM bid+prn), or placebo bid plus terbutaline 0.5mg as needed (placebo), all administered via Turbuhaler®. Primary efficacy variables were FEV1 and the sum of breathlessness and chest tightness scores combined symptom score. Formoterol significantly (P<0.01) increased FEV1 compared with placebo: FORM bid 6.5% (95% CI: 2.5, 10.7%); FORM bid+prn 11.8% (95% CI: 7.7, 16.2%). Combined symptom score decreased significantly in both formoterol groups compared with placebo: FORM bid −0.27 (95% CI: −0.49, −0.06; P=0.012); FORM bid+prn −0.32 (95% CI: −0.53, −0.11; P=0.0026). Similar significant (P<0.05) improvements were seen in both formoterol groups for morning peak expiratory flow, cough and sleep scores, and reliever use. In this study, formoterol 9μg bid via Turbuhaler® as maintenance therapy, with either formoterol or terbutaline as rescue medication, provided sustained improvements in lung function and COPD symptoms. Both formoterol regimens were well tolerated with no differences in adverse events or electrocardiogram profiles.}

However, incentive mechanism and its economic model for user participation have been less addressed so far in this research domain. This paper studies the economic model of user participation incentive in participatory sensing applications. To stimulate user participation, we design and evaluate a novel reverse auction based dynamic pricing incentive mechanism where users can sell their sensing data to a service provider with users’ claimed bid prices. The proposed incentive mechanism focuses on minimizing and stabilizing the incentive cost while maintaining adequate level of participants by preventing users from dropping out of participatory sensing applications. Compared with random selection based fixed pricing incentive mechanism, the proposed mechanism not only reduces the incentive cost for retaining the same number of participants but also improves the fairness of incentive distribution and social welfare. It also helps us to achieve the geographically balanced sensing measurements and, more importantly, can remove the burden of accurate price decision for user data that is the most difficult step in designing incentive mechanism.}

abstract = {Power generating companies have an opportunity to maximize their profit in electricity market by selling the energy at competitive prices under incomplete information of other rivals behavior. In a day-ahead energy market, Generating Company (GENCOs) sells the energy at optimal bid prices. To calculate the bid prices optimally and for maximizing the profit of generating company, this paper presents a solution for strategic bidding problem which is based on opposition theory enabled moth flame optimizer (OB-MFO). In this work, a new opposition theory enabled moth flame optimizer is proposed which have the additional concept of oppositional feature. First OB-MFO algorithm is tested on 22 benchmark and Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC-2017) functions, then it is applied to bidding problem of standard IEEE-14 bus (Test Case-1) and 7 generator power system (Test Case-2). The strategic bidding scheme for a generating company for single and multi hour trading duration in a day-ahead market is formulated. The major findings of the proposed approach are market clearing price (MCP), load dispatch and bid prices of five different blocks of different capacities. The meaningful comparison of the bidding results of other optimization techniques are presented. In addition to that price volatility analysis and exercise of market power analysis are also presented. The results confirm the effectiveness of proposed technique.}

Furthermore, evidence of bid clustering on currency denominations implies fundamental differences concerning how people respond to a monetary scale.

In our experiments, this latter behavior not only raises prices, but can also improve efficiency by mitigating the threshold problem. Comparisons between a combinatorial clock auction (CCA) and a simultaneous ascending auction (SAA) are reported.}

This can be attributed to the fact that Korean underwriters offer institutions more allocations of less underpriced shares. Second, institutions become more willing to bid aggressively as premarket interest increases. Third, institutional incentive to submit aggressive bids is positively related to underwriter pricing discretion. Fourth, bidding strategies are conditional on the different degrees of pricing discretion. Overall, this study's evidence concludes the endogeneity of institutional bidding decisions in premarket auctions.}

The proposed approach aims at evaluating the electricity market competitiveness with regard to the bidder strategies in order to prevent their anticompetitive actions. The framework is applied to a real data set regarding the Italian electricity market to enlighten its effectiveness in different scenarios, varying the number and capacity of participating bidders. The model can be employed as a basis for a decision support tool both for market participants (to define their optimal bidding strategy) and regulators (to avoid collusive strategies).}

Normalization preprocessing gives all attributes standard scores so that they can be compared. This research examines the effects of normalization methods through performance evaluations of normalization-based CBR models to improve construction cost estimation in the early design stages. Multi-family housing complexes were used as case studies, and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used for model validation. The performance of the CBR models was evaluated using the mean absolute error rate (MAER), mean squared deviation (MSD), mean absolute deviation (MAD), and standard deviation (SD) for accuracy and stability. The kernel density estimation (KDE) method was used to examine the appropriateness of the normalization methods. The results are expected to contribute to the enhancement of accuracy and stability of CBR-based cost estimation and to support decision-making. The suggested method could also be applied to other CBR areas such as energy prediction, noise management, bid decision-making, and scheduling, as well as other data-oriented methods, such as regression analysis and artificial neural networks.}

abstract = {Background
Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are widely used to relieve headache in Asia. However, it is uncertain whether there is robust evidence on the effects of CHMs for headache.
Purpose
To assess the effectiveness and safety of CHMs for headache using systematic review of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods
Electronic search was conducted on six databases from inception to January 2018. We included the RCTs that met the requirement of at least 4 out of the 7 domains according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool.
Results
Thirty RCTs with 3447 subjects were ultimately included for analysis and all trials were conducted in Asia. Meta-analysis showed that CHMs monotherapy were superior to placebo in reducing headache frequency [SMD −0.48 (95% CI −0.76, −0.20); p < 0.01], headache days [SMD −0.29 (95% CI −0.45, −0.13); p < 0.01], headache duration[SMD −0.58 (95% CI −0.81, −0.36); p < 0.01], headache intensity [SMD −0.42 (95% CI −0.62, −0.23); p < 0.01] and analgesic consumption [SMD −0.36 (95% CI −0.52, −0.21); p < 0.01] and improving clinical efficacy rate (p < 0.01). Similarly, CHMs monotherapy were superior to western conventional medicines (WCMs) in headache frequency [SMD −0.57 (95% CI −0.84, −0.29); p < 0.01], headache days (p < 0.01), analgesic consumption [SMD −1.63 (95% CI −1.98, −1.28); p < 0.01], headache intensity [SMD −0.81 (95% CI −1.06, −0.57); p < 0.01], and clinical efficacy rate [RR 1.24 (95% CI 1.18, 1.31); p < 0.01], except reducing headache duration (p > 0.05). CHMs adjunct therapy can improve clinical efficacy rate compared with WCMs alone [RR 1.15 (95% CI 1.09, 1.22); p < 0.01]. Meanwhile, CHMs had fewer adverse events than that of controls.
Conclusion
The findings supported, at least to an extent, the use of CHM for headache patients; however, we should treat the results cautiously because the clinical heterogeneity.}

Using data manually extracted from merger-related SEC filings, I create two measures of target board involvement in merger negotiations: the number of days it takes for the board to meet after the beginning of the sale process and the number of board meetings held throughout the entire process. I find that early board involvement in merger talks increases target shareholder returns and premiums, especially when shareholders have weak control over their firms and are thus in greater need of board protection. Although the two measures of target board activity do not affect acquirer cumulative abnormal returns or the likelihood of competition, such activity does reduce the likelihood of an excessive target termination fee. Robustness analyses dismiss an alternative explanation whereby attractive initial bids lead to both early board involvement and attractive final bids.}

Moreover, an application for filing public contracts was implemented. It enables a contracting authority to manage RDF data about itself and its contracts, suppliers to the contracts, to-be-contracted products and services, and actual tenders proposed by bidders. It also provides matchmaking services for finding similar contracts and suitable suppliers for a given call for tenders based on their history, which is a useful feature for contracting authorities.}

Our central identifying assumption is that the distribution of bidder values is increasing in the state. When the state-space is finite, such monotonicity implies the full-rank condition needed for identification. Further, we extend our approach to the conditionally independent private values model of Li et al. (2000), as well as to unobserved heterogeneity settings in which the implicit reserve price or the cost of bidding varies across auctions.}

A total of 266 DPNP patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive placebo, ABT-594 150μg BID, ABT-594 225μg BID, or ABT-594 300μg BID. Patients were titrated to a fixed-dose of ABT-594 over 7days and remained at this dose for another 6weeks. Compared to placebo, all three ABT-594 treatment groups showed significantly greater decreases on the average diary-based 0–10 Pain Rating Scale (PRS) score from baseline to final evaluation, the primary efficacy measure (placebo, −1.1; 150μg BID, −1.9; 225μg BID, −1.9; 300μg BID, −2.0). The proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% improvement in the average diary-based PRS was greater in all three ABT-594 treatment groups. However, adverse event (AE) dropout rates were significantly higher in all three ABT-594 treatment groups (28% for 150μg BID, 46% for 225μg BID, and 66% for 300μg BID) than for the placebo group (9%). Consistent with the expected side-effect profile of NNR agonists, the most frequently reported AEs were nausea, dizziness, vomiting, abnormal dreams, and asthenia. This study establishes proof of concept for NNR agonists as a new class of compounds for treating neuropathic pain.}

Board classification does reduce the likelihood of receiving a takeover bid, however, the economic effect of bid deterrence on the value of the firm is quite small. Overall, the evidence is inconsistent with the conventional wisdom that board classification is an anti-takeover device that facilitates managerial entrenchment.}

The study is anchored on the literatures addressing strategic human resource management and strategic contingencies of intra-organizational power. In an analysis of the data from the 2005 Cranet survey, results showed that (i) formalization attenuated a positive impact of bidder acquisitions and aggravated a negative impact of mergers on performance, but (ii) HRM strategic involvement and centralization of HRM practices boosted a positive impact of bidder acquisitions on performance. The study offers new insights about the role of HRM centrality, and suggests that mergers and acquisitions should be studied as differentiated ownership change processes.}

The analysis is based on characteristics of takeover transactions such as method of payment, listing status of the target company, geographic scope (cross-border vs. domestic), industry relatedness of the bidding and the target company, amongst other factors. We find that European bidders earn positive abnormal returns both in cross-border and domestic acquisitions, and there is a significant difference between the abnormal returns of stock and cash deals, and between acquisitions of listed and unlisted target companies. However, the cross-border wealth effects are not significantly different between the UK and Continental Europe. We find that bidding firm’s shareholders gain more in equity than in cash offers if they are located in the UK and if they acquire unlisted targets. Cash bids for listed targets are associated with higher abnormal returns for bidders located in Continental Europe. We do not find supportive evidence that industry diversification destroys value for shareholders of both Continental European and the UK bidders.}

However, little is known on how aVIC survival might contribute to disease pathogenesis. This study examined the temporal (disease severity-dependent) and spatial distribution of aVICs in MMVD valves, the expression of a range of apoptosis-related genes in cultured VICs from both normal (quiescent VIC (qVIC) and diseased (aVIC) valves, and the differential effects of doxorubicin treatment, as a trigger of apoptosis, on expression of the same genes. Activated myofibroblasts were identified in normal valves at the valve base only (the area closest to the annulus), and then became more numerous and apparent along the valve length as the disease progressed, with evidence of cell survival at the valve base. There were no significant differences in basal gene expression comparing qVICs and aVICs for CASP3, FAS, BID, BAX, BCL2, CASP8, DDIAS, XIAP and BIRC5. After doxorubicin treatment (2 mM) for 8 h there was significant difference (P < .05) in the expression of BID, BCL2, DDIAS, and CASP8, but when assessed for interactions using a mixed model ANOVA only CASP8 was significantly different because of treatment (P < .05). These data suggest aVIC survival in MMVD valves may be a consequence of heightened resistance of aVICs to apoptosis, but would require confirmation examining expression of the relevant proteins.}

abstract = {Mobile crowd sensing has emerged as an appealing paradigm to provide sensing data for its efficient economy. A large number of incentive mechanisms has been proposed for stimulating smartphone users to participate in mobile crowd sensing applications. Different from existing work, in addition to sensing tasks with diverse weights, we uniquely take into consideration the crucial dimension of location information when performing sensing tasks allocation. However, the location-sensitive weighted tasks are more vulnerable to the real life where each sensing task has the evident distinction. Meanwhile, the location sensitiveness leads to the increase of theoretical and computational complexity. In this paper, we investigate a truthful incentive mechanism which consists of two main components, winning bids determination algorithm and critical payment scheme. Since optimally determining the winning bids is NP hard, a near-optimal algorithm with polynomial-time computation complexity is proposed, which further approximates the optimal solution within a factor of 1+ln(n), where n is the maximum number of sensing tasks that a smartphone can accommodate. To guarantee the truthfulness, a critical payment scheme is proposed to induce smartphones to disclose their real costs. Through both rigid theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves truthfulness, individual rationality and high computation efficiency.}

abstract = {Online auctions are rapidly becoming one of the significant forms of electronic commerce for buying and selling goods and services. A good understanding of the workload of auction sites should provide insights about their activities and help in improving the quality of the service provided to their users. This paper presents a site level and a user level workload characterization of a real online auction site using data collected by automated agents. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) a detailed workload characterization of a real auction site; (ii) an analysis of the presence of heavy tailed distributions in this workload; (iii) an analysis of the bidding activity during closing minutes of auctions; and (iv) an analysis of the arrival rate process of bidders and bids within clusters based on different attributes. These results can be used to devise dynamic pricing and promotion models to improve revenue throughput of online auction sites.}

Using a sample of 177 Australian companies, I document that market quality is generally higher in the ASX than in Chi-X on days with macroeconomic news announcements. Trading activity is higher while trading cost is lower. Information shocks have larger immediate impact but lower persistence in the ASX compared to Chi-X. The pattern of intraday serial dependence in returns also reveals that that order imbalances in the ASX have smaller impact than in Chi-X, indicating that the former offers greater price efficiency. These results imply that the ASX remains the preferred destination for traders who seek liquidity and cheaper trading options.}

How are these sensitivities influenced by size of the customers' firms and by the respondents' job functions? Answers to these issues are provided based on an exploratory field experiment of manufacturers' choices of subcontractors in the Finnish metal industry. As hypothesized, customers were most sensitive to achieving contracted levels of reliability of delivery: avoiding low (90%) delivery standards and meeting 100% delivery standards. Large-sized customers were particularly sensitive to price increases: large negative utilities were found for 20% price increases. Contrary to our expectations, offering ISO 9000 quality standards were not highly valued by customers. The findings provide strategic guidelines for designing subcontractor bid responses to requests for quotations: stay focused on the meat-and-potato issues, guarantee that delivery standards will be met, and maintain current prices.}

Understanding how macroeconomic events shape liquidity in this market is important for both hedgers and speculators. Using high-frequency data, we consider three elements of market liquidity to achieve a detailed picture of liquidity provision in the period around monetary policy announcements; the bid-ask spread, market depth, and order book slope. We show that liquidity is removed from the market around 2-mins prior to the announcement, is exceptionally low at the time of the announcement, and then reverts to normal within 9-mins of the announcement. The magnitude of the liquidity response is influenced by the size of the monetary policy surprise, consistent with traders that seek to protect themselves when the risk of adverse selection is greatest. The liquidity response is also determined by the term structure of the futures curve and prevailing credit conditions.}

Empirical research, however, shows that a high proportion of bidders do not trade on the target's shares prior to the tender offer announcement. This paper presents a model in which the bidder trades in the open market before announcing a tender offer and the incumbent shareholders form beliefs about the rival's quality given the order size. Market liquidity allows the potential bidder to partially hide her trade, and thus insiders are not able to ascertain whether an increase in volume indicates toehold acquisition. Stock price prior to the announcement date and market perception about the probability of a takeover are therefore contingent on players actions. We show that in some situations no trade will be optimal, and a negative relationship between takeover premium and toehold size arises. Interestingly, stock liquidity and initial stake are positively related. Our results also provide a theoretical basis for the observed pre-bid stock price dynamics. In particular, we show that the ratio between price runup and bid premium is increasing in the toehold size.}

abstract = {Background: Triptans are a recommended first-line treatment for moderate to severe migraine. Objective: Using clinical trial data, we evaluated the safety and tolerability of frovatriptan as acute treatment (AT) and as short-term preventive (STP) therapy for menstrual migraine (MM). Methods: Data from 2 Phase III AT trials (AT1: randomized, placebo controlled, 1 attack; AT2: 12-months, noncomparative, open label) and 3 Phase IIIb STP trials in MM (MMP1 and MMP2: randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, 3 perimenstrual periods; MMP3: open label, noncomparative, 12 perimenstrual periods) were analyzed. In AT1, patients treated each attack with frovatriptan 2.5 mg, sumatriptan 100 mg, or placebo. In AT2, they used frovatriptan 2.5 mg. In MMP1 and MMP2, women administered frovatriptan 2.5 mg for 6 days during the perimenstrual period, taking a loading dose of 2 or 4 tablets on day 1, followed by once-daily or BID frovatriptan 2.5 mg, respectively; in MMP3, they used BID frovatriptan 2.5 mg. In AT1, which was previously published in part, group differences in adverse events (AEs) were analyzed using the Fisher exact test, and response rates were compared using logistic regression. Post hoc analyses of sustained pain-free status with no AEs (SNAE) and sustained pain response with no AEs (SPRNAE) were performed using a 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction. For AT2 and the STP studies, data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results of individual safety analyses for the STP studies were previously reported; the present report includes new results from a pooled analysis of MMP1 and MMP2 and a new analysis of MMP3 in which AEs were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 8.0. Results: AT1 included 1206 patients in the safety group; AT2 included 496. In the STP studies, safety data were collected for 1487 women. In AT1 and AT2, 85.6% and 88.3%, respectively, of enrolled patients were women. Overall, AEs were generally mild to moderate (AT studies: 82.3%-90.0%; STP studies: 78.9%89.5%). In AT1, 27.3% (131/480) of frovatriptan patients, 33.4% (161/482) of sumatriptan patients, and 14.8% (36/244) of placebo patients experienced an AE considered possibly or probably related to treatment (P < 0.001 for either drug vs placebo).There were no significant differences between frovatriptan and sumatriptan in SNAE at 4 to 24 hours or in SPRNAE at 2 to 24 hours or at 4 to 24 hours. In randomized, controlled STP trials for MM, AEs were reported by 57.8% (166/287, BID) and 63.4% (210/331, once daily) of frovatriptan users versus 62.8% (216/344) of placebo recipients. There were no consistent differences in AEs reported by patients with potential cardiovascular risk or in AEs related to the use of estrogencontaining contraceptives (ECCs). Conclusions: In randomized controlled trials and 12-month open-label studies, frovatriptan was well tolerated in these women during AT and STP therapy for MM. Subgroup analyses provide preliminary evidence of tolerability in women using ECCs and in women with comorbidities that do not contraindicate triptan use but may be suggestive of cardiovascular risk.}

In this context, auctions for the deployment of stand-alone solar home systems (SASHS) are an appropriate alternative to facilitate access to electricity in rural areas. The aim of this paper is to analyze the design elements and functioning of the SASHS auction in Peru in order to derive lessons for the effective and efficient design of those auctions. Based on an analytical framework developed elsewhere, this article draws on official documents and data, secondary material and interviews with stakeholders. Our results show that some design elements are particularly suitable in this regard. In contrast to renewable electricity auctions in general, for which the volume auctioned is usually set as capacity (MW) or generation (MWh), the volume of SASHS auctions should be set in terms of the number of SASHS providing an electricity service. Geographical diversity, with different auctions per region, would ensure the adoption of a minimum amount of SASHS in a given geographical area. Financial solvency, but not technical reputation, should be required. Otherwise, only the incumbents would be able to participate in the auction. The choice of technology-specific, price-only, sealed-bid, single-item auctions brings benefits in terms of economies of scale, lower support or transaction costs and a greater transparency or simplicity. A correction factor on the remuneration which accounts for the quality of the service, as applied in the Peru auction, is suitable for this type of auctions. Finally, provision of technical information, which facilitates the participation in the auction, and the implementation of a non-disclosed ceiling price are deemed appropriate. In contrast, given the low presence of local companies in the Peruvian PV market, the adoption of local content requirements would lead to higher support costs without significantly increasing the local development potential.}

We find that the proportion of non-publicly tradable shares over total outstanding shares is positively related to the probability of firms being block trade targets before the split-share structure reform. Ownership concentration, director ownership, and firm size were negatively related to the frequency of firms being block trade targets during the pre-reform period. Pre-reform firms with high free cash flow were likely to be block trade targets, and bidders paid a high premium to acquire those companies. The cost of a block trade increased significantly after the split-share structure reform, and the frequency of block trades declined considerably. These results suggest that before the reform Chinese bidders mainly pursued private benefits of control rather than capital gains from value-increasing takeovers. After the reform, bidders have bought tradable shares and paid a negative premium, suggesting that being a blockholder in Chinese companies implies costs that exceed benefits.}

In this paper we studied whether ovarian cortex adjacent to excised small (diameter ≤ 4 cm) endometriotic cyst (here referred as Cortex Surrounding Endometriotic Cyst, CSEC) showed signs of tissue damages by evaluating the expression of proteins involved in DNA repair and apoptosis. To this end, phosphorylated H2A.X, Chk1 and 2, ATM and ATR, Bcl-2, Bid, phosphorylated and total p53, caspases (9, 8 and 3), XIAP, phosphorylated and total NFκB were analyzed by western blot. Results showed that caspase 8, XIAP, p53/p-p53 and NFκB were more abundantly expressed in all samples of CSEC group in comparison with ovarian cortex of controls. Conversely, the levels of the other proteins were comparable between the two groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that NFκB, caspase 8 and p53/p-p53 elevated expressions in samples of CSEC can be considered as an early sign of tissue injury, indicating that ovarian cortex is already sensitized to apoptosis and inflammation. Therefore, excision of EC should occur very early, to avoid further ovarian damages.}

Following this theory, four indicators were developed to measure people’s behavioural intentions for improving air quality; two of these indicators were correlated with contingent valuation survey. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to estimate our Perception-based Behavioural Intention Model (PBIM) by using a cross-sectional data set of 759 residents of the Jinchuan mining area in Gansu Province, China. We found that Jinchuan residents’ WTP for improving local air quality was significantly influenced by the perceived health risk of hazardous pollutants, environmental knowledge, socioeconomic status, current health condition, gender, work environment, and proximity to the pollution source. This study shows that SEM outperforms conventional CVM econometrically and in terms of the provision of relevant policy information.}

Next, the adverse selection costs of uninformed buyers and sellers and the difference of their asset valuations determine the size of their bid-ask spread. An analysis of European carbon futures data confirms the relevance of these implications. Moreover, we detect a diagonal effect that results in a positive correlation of market orders, which is driven by adverse selection, then by order splitting strategies and by imitative strategies of uninformed traders to a lesser extent.}

In our field experiment, we examine prices of baseball cards sold on eBay with or without third party certification. In addition, the certifier was either independent or deeply immersed in providing other services to market participants. We find that market participants pay a significant premium for certified cards. Certifiers who are deeply immersed (and therefore apparently less independent) also provide higher quality service in the form of being stricter graders, command larger price premiums, and dominate in market share. Implications for independence and audit quality are discussed.}

MLR-1023, called Tolimidone when evaluated unsuccessfully by Pfizer for gastric ulcer disease, has been repurposed as a novel oral insulin sensitizer with its effects mediated by selective activation of Lyn kinase. We aimed to evaluate the optimal dose, efficacy and safety of MLR-1023 in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Type 2 diabetes patients (18–75 years) on diet/exercise therapy were randomized and double-blinded to receive MLR-1023 (100-mg or 200-mg, once-daily [qd] or twice-daily [bid]) or matching placebo for 28 days. The primary endpoint was postprandial glucose (PPG) area under the curve (AUC0–3h) in a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) at day 29. Secondary endpoints included changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, HbA1c, lipids and body weight and adverse events. ANCOVA model was used for efficacy analysis.
Results
The placebo-corrected least-squares mean differences (ΔLSM) in MMTT PPG AUC0-3 h (mmol/L) were −5.96 and −5.6 (both p = 0.03) in the MLR-1023 100-mg qd and 100-mg bid groups, respectively. The placebo-corrected ΔLSM in FPG (mmol/L) was −2.34 (p = 0.003) in the MLR-1023 100-mg qd group. Triglycerides improved with MLR-1023 (ΔLSM, −0.56 mmol/L, p = 0.07 and −0.59 mmol/L, p = 0.05) in the 200mgqd and 200 mg bid groups, respectively. Reductions in fasting insulin, HbA1c and body weight were not statistically significant. Most common adverse events with MLR-1023 treatment were headache (4.2%) and somnolence (2.5%).
Conclusions
MLR-1023 100-mg once-daily for 4 weeks was the most effective dose with significant reduction in PPG AUC following a MMTT. MLR-1023 was safe and well-tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes. Clinical Trials Registration Number: NCT02317796}

Consistent with the hypothesis that some firms conduct IPOs to facilitate future M&A activity, we find that aspects of IPO deal structure predict whether a newly public firm subsequently becomes a bidder or target. These characteristics include underwriter quality, promotional activity, pricing, proceeds, ownership structure, and issuance activity suggestive of market timing. Investors appear to rely on these observable aspects of a firm's going public process to anticipate the implications of M&A activity for security valuation. Specifically, when newly public firms with IPO deal structures predictive of acquisition activity announce an acquisition their stock returns are indistinguishable from zero. In contrast, abnormal returns to acquisition announcements by unlikely or surprise bidders are positive on average. These results suggest that the going public process has important implications for future M&A activity and valuation.}

The results show that land remises will influence local economic growth through fiscal relations and, in turn, the local governments’ fiscal behaviors and economic indicators will affect the land remise scale and price. This paper concludes that, under fiscal decentralization, local governments obtain the balance of payments through the sale of more land, resulting in a rapid increase in land remise scale and price; under the economic target assessment, the local government will use the agreement to sell industrial land at a low price and use the “bid invitation, auction and listing” method to sell commercial land at a high price. In addition, the scale, proportion and prices of the “bid invitation, auction and listing” remise mode are far higher than those of the agreement mode. This phenomenon appears more obviously in regions with a strong degree of financial dependence and a high economic development level.}

Ethnopharmacological relevance
Essential hypertension is a prevalence chronic cardiovascular disease, which is treated by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China. Metabolomics approach has achieved more attention in pharmacology studies of natural products. Tianma Gouteng Decoction (TGD) is effective for the therapeutic of hypertension in China. We aimed to investigate antihypertension effect of TGD on spontaneous hypertension rat (SHR) with live-Yang hyperactivity hypertension (Gan Yang Shang Kang, GYSK) and explore the mechanism by metabolomics method.
Materials and methods
After establishing the GYSK-SHR model by giving aconite decoction, rats were randomly divided into four groups including model group, TGD qd group (66.88 mg/kg, once a day), TGD bid group (33.44 mg/kg, twice a day), TGD tid group (22.29 mg/kg, three times a day). Blood pressure (BP) and indexes of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS system) were measured. Metabolic profiling of rat plasma samples was performed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, which was analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) to explore the relationship between metabolic pathways and hypertension.
Results
To better explain the role of TGD on hypertension, we detected three different frequencies of TGD treatment with equal dosage. TGD reduced the BP in GYSH-SHR model and regulated the serum levels of NE, Ang II, ET, 5-HT, CRP, RENIN and ALD especially at TGD bid group. By UPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis, we found 47 potential biomarkers in GYSK-SHR rats from the plasma metabolites, among which 15 biomarkers were regulated by TGD. Consisted with the antihypertension activity, TGD bid group showed the significantly moderating effect on the regulating biomarkers.
Conclusions
TGD exhibited the antihypertensive activity at the frequency of administration twice a day, which had the association with RAAS system and mediated 15 biomarkers by regulating metabolisms of glycerol phospholipid, sphingomyelin, energy and amino acid.}

Procurement of equipment is a complex process, which requires the evaluation of multiple suppliers against project targets. Analysis is usually performed manually, is time consuming, and certain tradeoffs may be overlooked. A consistent and applicable tool to support procurement decisions has been missing. The results of this research take significant steps to fill this gap. The system integrates historical data, market assessment, and bid information to aid commercial assessment and recommendation of suppliers. The supplier selection module uses the Aspiration Interactive Method (AIM) to analyze the information. Results of two selection cases were compared against firms' recommendations. The system enables rapid evaluation and comparison of several supply alternatives, thereby improving the consistency and quality of commercial analysis in the early phases of projects.}

We re-examine these issues in an environment in which bidders are allowed to endogenously choose in which auction format to participate. Our findings are that more bidders choose to enter the ascending auction than the first price sealed bid auction and this extra entry is enough to make up the revenue difference between the formats. Consequently, we find that both formats raise approximately the same amount of revenue. They also generate efficiency levels and bidder earnings that are roughly equivalent across mechanisms though the earnings in the ascending might be slightly higher.}

The Kansas government began to insure highway paving firms against oil price risk in 2006. The analysis compares Kansas to Iowa, which has an otherwise similar highway procurement system but never introduced such a policy. Using data from 1998 to 2012, I show that the policy reduced average bid sensitivity to oil price volatility. Private firms with high credit risk and low industry diversification exhibit the most risk pass-through, while public firms exhibit no pass-through. Family-owned firms do not have a higher than average cost of risk. Financial constraints and distress costs appear to best explain the cost of risk management, rather than risk aversion, information, or agency problems.}

This compound especially affects the reproductive organs, but it can also show hepatotoxic effects. The Bufonidae family has a peculiar organ named Bidder’s organ, considered by some authors as a rudimentary ovary, but capable to respond to some external stimuli. This study investigated flutamide effects on testes and Bidder’s organ germ cells, liver pigmentation, and sexual hormones levels in Rhinella schneideri males. We randomly divided 15 males in three groups (N=5): two groups were injected with flutamide, at 1 and 5mg/kg, while the control group received only mineral oil, for 7days. After euthanasia, blood samples were collected and the organs were sent to histological routine. In the testes, both treatments caused an increase in spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and a decrease in spermatozoa and locular area. In the Bidder’s organ, the final diplotene oocytes increased, but the initial diplotene, degrading and atresic oocytes reduced in both treatments. The lipofuscin in the Bidder’s organ was not affected. In the liver, melanin and lipofuscin increased only for the 1mg/kg flutamide treatment. The 5mg/kg treatment did not affect the liver. Serum testosterone and estradiol levels did not vary compared with the control group. This compound has antiandrogenic activity, which can affect the spermatogenetic process. The decrease in degrading and atresic Bidderian oocytes indicated that flutamide could stimulate the organ, retarding the degradation processes. The increase in liver melanin, which has protective role, and lipofuscin, a sign of degradation, indicates that flutamide cause hepatotoxic effects. So we conclude that flutamide negatively affects the testes, especially by reducing the sperm area, and the liver, inducing cell degradation and producing protective responses. Furthermore, the compound encourages lower degradation rates of the Bidder’s organ germ cells.}

Negative determinants include multiple daily dosing (MDD), chronic duration, and asymptomatic disease. Reports suggest that once-daily (QD) dosing may improve adherence, but their findings are inconclusive. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the rates of adherence with QD, twice-daily (BID), and MDD antihypertensive drug regimens. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases were searched to identify comparative trials of patient adherence to antihypertensive medication in solid, oral formulations. Data were combined using a random-effects meta-analytic model. Results: Eight studies involving a total of 11,485 observations were included (1830 for QD dosing, 4405 for BID dosing, 4147 for dosing >2 times daily [>BID], and 9655 for MDD), in which the primary objective was to assess adherence. The average adherence rate for QD dosing (91.4%, SD = 2.2%) was significantly higher (Z = 4.46, P < 0.001) than for MDD (83.2%, SD = 3.5%). This rate was also significantly higher (Z = 2.22, P = 0.026) than for BID dosing (92.7% [SD = 2.3%] vs 87.1% [SD = 2.9%]). The difference in adherence rates between BID dosing (90.8%, SD = 4.7%) and >BID dosing (86.3%, SD = 6.7%) was not significant (Z = 1.82, P = 0.069). Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that with antihypertensive medications, QD dosing regimens are associated with higher rates of adherence than either BID or MDD regimens.}

In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional fairness approach based on priorities. For that purpose, a recurrent auction scenario is assumed, in which the auctioneer keeps track of winner and losers. From that information, the priority methods are defined based on the lost auctions number, the number of consecutive loses, and the fitness of their loser bids. Moreover, some methods contain a probabilistic parameter that enables handling wealth ranking disorders due to fairness. We test our approach in real-data based simulator which emulates an industrial production environment where several resource providers compete to perform different tasks. The results pointed that multi-dimensional fairness incentives agents to remain in the market whilst it improves the equity of the wealth distribution without compromising the quality of the allocation attributes.}

The DREAMtherapy (Dual REctal Angiogenesis MEK inhibition radiotherapy) trial is a novel intertwined design whereby two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (cediranib and selumetinib) were independently evaluated with rectal chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in an efficient manner to limit the extended follow-up period often required for radiotherapy studies.
Patients and methods
Cediranib or selumetinib was commenced 10 days before and then continued with RT (45 Gy/25#/5 wks) and capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice a day (BID)). When three patients in the cediranib 15-mg once daily (OD) cohort were in the surveillance period, recruitment to the selumetinib cohort commenced. This alternating schedule was followed throughout. Three cediranib (15, 20 and 30 mg OD) and two selumetinib cohorts (50 and 75 mg BID) were planned. Circulating and imaging biomarkers of inflammation/angiogenesis were evaluated.
Results
In case of cediranib, dose-limiting diarrhoea, fatigue and skin reactions were seen in the 30-mg OD cohort, and therefore, 20 mg OD was defined as the maximum tolerated dose. Forty-one percent patients achieved a clinical or pathological complete response (7/17), and 53% (9/17) had an excellent clinical or pathological response (ECPR). Significantly lower level of pre-treatment plasma tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) was found in patients who had an ECPR. In case of selumetinib, the 50-mg BID cohort was poorly tolerated (fatigue and diarrhoea); a reduced dose cohort of 75-mg OD was opened which was also poorly tolerated, and further recruitment was abandoned. Of the 12 patients treated, two attained an ECPR (17%).
Conclusions
This novel intertwined trial design is an effective way to independently investigate multiple agents with radiotherapy. The combination of cediranib with CRT was well tolerated with encouraging efficacy. TNFα emerged as a potential predictive biomarker of response and warrants further evaluation.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study was undertaken to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of empagliflozin 5 mg twice daily (BID) and 10 mg once daily (QD) in healthy subjects.
Methods
In an open-label, 2-way crossover study, subjects (n = 16) received empagliflozin 5 mg BID for 5 days and empagliflozin 10 mg QD for 5 days in a randomized order, with a washout period of ≥6 days between each treatment. The primary objective was the comparison of the overall exposure during a 24-hour period at steady state (AUC0−24,ss) for empagliflozin, based on standard bioequivalence criteria, with BID and QD dose regimens.
Findings
The study population comprised 7 (43.8%) men and 9 (56.3%) women with a baseline median age of 38.0 years (range, 23−47 years) and a median body mass index of 23.3 kg/m2 (range, 19.8−27.8 kg/m2). Based on standard bioequivalence criteria, there was no difference in the overall exposure of empagliflozin between BID and QD dose regimens (geometric mean ratio of AUC0−24,ss for empagliflozin 5 mg BID compared with empagliflozin 10 mg QD = 99.36%; 90% CI, 94.29−104.71). For empagliflozin 10 mg QD, mean (%CV) AUC during the dosing interval was 1900 nmol · h/L (20.6%), mean (%CV) Cmax,ss was 330 nmol/L (25.3%), and median (range) Tmax,ss was 1.0 hour (0.7−2.0 hours). For empagliflozin 5 mg BID, mean (%CV) AUC during the dosing interval was 1010 nmol · h/L (15.1%) and 867 nmol · h/L (18.6%) after the morning and evening dose, respectively, mean (%CV) Cmax,ss was 193 nmol/L (16.5%) and 120 nmol/L (21.0%), respectively, and median Tmax,ss was 1.0 hour (range, 0.7−2.0 hours) and 2.0 hours (range, 1.0−4.0 hours), respectively. The mean (%CV) cumulative amount of glucose excreted in urine during 24 hours was 52.1 g (32.1%) with empagliflozin 5 mg BID and 43.9 g (30.3%) with empagliflozin 10 mg QD. Adverse events were reported in six subjects (37.5%) receiving empagliflozin 5 mg BID and four (25.0%) receiving empagliflozin 10 mg QD. Headache was the most frequent AE. No severe, serious, or drug-related AEs were reported.
Implications
There were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties between BID and QD dose regimens of empagliflozin in healthy subjects. Both dose regimens were well tolerated. EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT) number: 2009-012524-90.}

abstract = {In a large sample of U.S. M&As over 1990–2007 we find that the bidders’ poor governance leads to lower levels of internal and external risk-taking, but the risk propensity of target firms does not appear to be compromised by their governance structure. Further, value is created when risk-takers acquire risk-avoiding target firms, but it is destroyed when bidders with a conservative investment policy takeover risk-taking target firms. This value effect is particularly pronounced when bidders are relatively better governed. Thus, our study offers new direct evidence that strategic risk transfer is an important channel of value creation in M&As.}

In many assembly lines Vision Systems are applied that can identify anomalies, read labels, count components and such like. However these systems are sensitive to lighting and setup conditions, and in many cases the technology is unable to read or classify, leaving gaps in the assembly process where human validation is a necessity. A typically manufacturing response is to add further quality control check layers onto the backend of the process. An ideal Industry 4.0 Smart Manufacturing vision system would keep track of components being used, identify anomalies and identify processes successfully during the production stage providing efficient quality checks in real-time, thus creating a more efficient Quality Control process, and move closer to Zero-Defect scenario. One area in which Vision Systems are rarely used is the medical technology sector, due to the high standards required to approve a line. Because current Vision Systems can fail in different setup conditions, this makes them a risk and so, Quality Control is not in any way aided or improved upon. This study examines the application of Deep Learning with neural networks on components from a medical technology company, to demonstrate how they can be used as a more reliable and less prone to error vision system, that can track the components in real time regardless of lighting conditions and other constraints and perform other Quality Control checks.}

This chapter discusses different types of risks that are attributable to poor data quality as well as an approach to correlating business impacts to data flaws. To be able to communicate the value of data quality improvement, it is necessary to be able to characterize the loss of value that is attributable to poor data quality. The chapter gives some basic understanding of data use, information value, and the ways that information value degrades when data does not meet quality expectations, different categories of business impacts attributable to poor information quality, ways to facilitate identification, and classification of cost impacts related to poor data quality. The objectives of designing an impact hierarchy are twofold. First, the original intention of determining how poor data quality impacts one's business processes is a much more manageable task when it can be broken up into small analytic pieces. The categorical hierarchy of impact areas naturally map to the future performance reporting structure for gauging improvement. As one identifies where poor data quality impacts the business, one also identifies where data quality improvement enhances the business. This provides a solid framework for quantifying measurable performance metrics that is eventually used to craft key data quality performance indicators.}

A set of 30 criteria are identified for assessing supplier selection for facilities and field development projects across the petroleum industry. Bidders are assessed in terms of these criteria, with varying degrees of uncertainty and subjectivity, using linguistic scoring terms that are then transformed into crisp and fuzzy numerical sets. Eight MCDM scoring methods are described mathematically and applied to a facilities-procurement scenario in order to analyze a linguistic-assessment matrix for five alternative bidders using the 30 recommended criteria. These scoring methods are: linear; non-linear; the order of preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS); Fuzzy TOPSIS (with and without entropy weighting); and, intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS (IFT) with three alternative methods for calculating entropy weighting (We). Performance of the eight methods is assessed by comparing calculated rankings for the five bidders in relation to the defined supplier selection scenario for a base case and ten sensitivity cases. The results of the analysis suggest that entropy weightings applied to fuzzy sets provide more consistent bidder selection, and led to the proposal of a new intuitionistic-fuzzy-TOPSIS-method-with-flexible-entropy-weighting method that enables the entropy weighting scale to be tuned to suit the circumstances of specific scenarios using equation 30 to flexibly normalize the entropy weighting scale.}

abstract = {Background
This double-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate inhaled budesonide and oral dexamethasone compared with placebo for their prophylactic efficacy against acute mountain sickness after acute high-altitude exposure.
Methods
There were 138 healthy young male lowland residents recruited and randomly assigned to receive inhaled budesonide (200 μg, twice a day [bid]), oral dexamethasone (4 mg, bid), or placebo (46 in each group). They traveled to 3900 m altitude from 400 m by car. Medication started 1 day before high-altitude exposure and continued until the third day of exposure. Primary outcome measure was the incidence of acute mountain sickness after exposure.
Results
One hundred twenty-four subjects completed the study (42, 39, and 43 in the budesonide, dexamethasone, and placebo groups, respectively). Demographic characteristics were comparable among the 3 groups. After high-altitude exposure, significantly fewer participants in the budesonide (23.81%) and dexamethasone (30.77%) groups developed acute mountain sickness compared with participants receiving placebo (60.46%) (P = .0006 and P = .0071, respectively). Both the budesonide and dexamethasone groups had lower heart rate and higher pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) than the placebo group at altitude. Only the budesonide group demonstrated less deterioration in forced vital capacity and sleep quality than the placebo group. Four subjects in the dexamethasone group reported adverse reactions.
Conclusions
Both inhaled budesonide (200 μg, bid) and oral dexamethasone (4 mg, bid) were effective for the prevention of acute mountain sickness, especially its severe form, compared with placebo. Budesonide caused fewer adverse reactions than dexamethasone.}

This paper reviews electricity market rules to inform an accurate representation of storage bidding behavior in day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) electricity markets. Storage dispatch strategies are explored using production cost and price-taker models to address two related research questions: (1) will storage assets receive the highest remuneration by bidding into DA markets, bidding into RT markets, or redispatching bids in both markets and (2) how accurate must forecast information be for a redispatch strategy to improve remuneration? Results show that with sufficient ability to forecast prices, redispatching a DA schedule in the RT takes advantage of both markets: a longer dispatch horizon as well as more volatile prices.}

The analysis employs a two-stage efficiency analysis with a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in the first stage and a Tobit panel model in the second stage. Both a base model with conventional output variables and a model which includes additional indicators of service quality provide robust results regarding the factors which explain efficiency differences between PTAs. PTAs with a higher share of tendering, a higher share of gross contracts and longer and smaller contracts were more efficient than others, with the effect being even stronger when including quality of service indicators. A further finding is the change of PTA’s ranking when including quality of service. Therefore, neglecting quality of service and restricting efficiency analysis to conventional output measures might result in misleading policies.}

Post-objective methods of weight determination are shown to enhance the integrity of the evaluation process and to limit corruption in a public tender.

Budgeting and cost estimation methods vary in terms of complexity and accuracy, but, most important, in the way they address contingency reserves in the total budget. The aim of this research is to explore the most applicable budgeting methods for infrastructure projects with regard to the inclusion of risks related costs to the overall budget and demonstrate the capacity of stochastic processes for optimizing overall budgets. Case- based reasoning, multiple regression analysis, Monte Carlo simulation and deterministic methods are briefly presented in terms of theoretical approach, requirements, accuracy and integration of risks. Two prevailing budgeting methods, namely the deterministic and Monte Carlo simulation are applied on a real case of reinforced concrete works for a building project; the comparison of the results highlights the two major findings of this research: a) stochastic processes provide more accurate justification of the contingency reserves required for inclusion of risks in budgets of infrastructure projects, and b) stochastic processes are optimum for the definition of realistic contingency reserves that, in turn, results to more competitive bids. The research concludes with the suggestion that stochastic processes should be used for risk based budgeting of infrastructure projects.}

In contrast to overconfident managers, non-overconfident managers conduct value-creative acquisition deals in all valuation periods. In addition, when we control for acquirer and deal characteristics, we find that bidders with non-overconfident managers gain the most in high valuation periods, while firms are better off without overconfident managers in any type of market conditions.}

The resource being valued is a public project to protect salt marshes against the spread of an invasive aquatic plant in the Brest roadstead (France). Valuation uncertainty is captured through a variant of payment card format where respondents are given the opportunity to report their WTP as either a single value (Option A) or an interval of values (Option B). The ordering effect is tested using both parametric models that ignore and control for the potential sample selection bias related to the choice between Option A and Option B, as well as non-parametric models. The results suggest that (1) respondents place substantial WTP values on salt marsh conservation, and (2) the ordering effect is linked to respondent uncertainty since only uncertain respondents react differently to changes in the order of presenting bid amounts. Specifically, for uncertain respondents, putting bid amounts in ascending order yields lower welfare estimates than putting bid amounts in descending order or random order. Policy recommendations and options to deal with ordering effect are discussed.}

When unobserved heterogeneity affects both perceived quality and averting behavior, identification of the demand function is plagued by a problem of endogeneity. In this paper, we propose the use of an auxiliary (first stage) model of perceived quality as a function of objective quality to recover unbiased and microconsistent estimates of marginal willingness to pay for the provision of the public good. The approach can be applied when people have well-formed perceptions of the quality of the good, a prerequisite for the averting expenditures method, and when objective quality of provision is plausibly exogenous. We illustrate the approach with data on averting expenditures for two qualitative aspects of household tap water networks: water hardness and aesthetic quality in terms of taste and odor.}

Methods
A 38-week, randomised, open-label, treat-to-target (HbA1c < 7.0%) trial in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (on basal insulin ± oral antidiabetic drugs; HbA1c 7.0–10.0%).

Intensification to IDegAsp twice daily (BID) was permitted at W26 + W32, or with additional IAsp injections at W26 (maximum IAsp BID) or W32 (maximum IAsp three-times daily).
Results
For W0–W26, mean percentage-change (standard deviation) HbA1c was: IDegAsp, −1.1 (0.9); IGlar U100 + IAsp, −1.1 (0.8); estimated treatment difference: 0.07% (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.06; 0.21) confirmed non-inferiority. At W26 and W38, target HbA1c achievement, and mean fasting and postprandial glucose were similar across groups. At W38, more subjects achieved target HbA1c without hypoglycaemia with IDegAsp (22.5%) than with IGlar U100 + IAsp (21.1%), with significantly fewer nocturnal episodes (W0–W38, estimated rate ratio: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.40; 0.93]). Safety profiles were similar across treatment groups throughout.
Conclusions
IDegAsp OD/BID are effective treatment intensification options versus multiple injection basal–bolus therapies, achieving similar glycaemic control, with significantly less nocturnal hypoglycaemia.}

As a result, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is increasingly endorsed by governmental policies. It can be even more encouraged by promoting the provision of different ancillary services using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled EVs, since EV owners may obtain additional profit by market participation. This paper presents an assessment of the economic benefits of using EVs to participate in the primary frequency regulation markets from the EV owner perspective. A heuristic method is proposed to optimize the power bid that maximizes the EV owners’ revenue along with a set of operational strategies that facilitates the service provision, which is evaluated using a simulation-based approach. A comparison analysis is performed to individually demonstrate the economic potential that four EVs with different battery capacities may offer to the owner when providing frequency-controlled normal operation reserves (FCR-N) in the Nord Pool market. The assessment of the power bid is performed considering the influence of the operation strategies and customer preferences. In addition, the effect of FCR-N on EV battery degradation and the grid impact caused by the service provision are considered in the economic evaluation. The results estimate annual benefits ranging between €100 and €1100 per vehicle, which demonstrates that EV owners can obtain substantial revenues by providing FCR-N.}

This configuration is increasingly being proposed for the installation of distributed management systems based on economic criteria in contexts such as the Smart Grid, computational grids and the cloud. In particular, these solutions are commonly complemented by the presence of software agents which automate the users’ participation in an intelligent manner. This work focuses on the effect that the distribution of the bidders’ participation actually has on the effectiveness of parallel auctions as management system. Firstly, the problem is introduced, showing that, in practice, bidders have incentives to prefer some auctions over others, thus tending to concentrate their participation in a limited subset of auctions. Also, as part of the theoretical formulation, with the aim of preserving the essence of markets and keeping competition active, it establishes a set of players’ essential rights that any solution to the problem should preserve. The text then continues with the design and implementation of a regulatory mechanism that uniformly distributes buyers’ participation among the available auctions. Realistic experiments are provided in order to demonstrate both the negative effects that buyers’ concentration actually causes, and the effectiveness of the new regulatory mechanism, which manages to strengthen parallel auctions as a distributed management system. Likewise, it is proven that the solution is scalable, reactive and suitable for large distributed environments.}

One of the critical issues in the urbanisation process in Africa has been the provision of adequate housing in both quantitative and qualitative terms for the increasing urban population. The paper emphasises the importance of housing in economic and social development and discusses the existing housing conditions in many urban centres of Africa. The criteria for assessment of the need for housing in Africa are outlined and measures for facing the housing challenge in the urbanisation process of Africa outlined. The paper concludes by emphasising the need for integrating investment in housing with investment in other sectors of the developing economy of Africa.}

When offsets are used for compliance, it is important that they are additional in the sense that the payment from the trading program induces environmental benefits that would not occur without the program. In this paper we analyze a water quality trading program in Ohio, U.S., to estimate the extent to which the offsets are additional. Using data from the program and a farmer survey, we estimate the number of additional conservation practices that are adopted by farmers who participated in the trading program relative to the counterfactual outcome without the program. Using matching methods, we find no statistically significant increase in the number of conservation practices due to the trading program. We also examine whether the trading program may have crowded out government funding. We also do not find significant evidence for such crowding out, instead finding some evidence that the trading program may have led to greater participation in federal cost-share programs.}

In the succeeding analysis the bidding on requests from non-permanent customers is treated as investments in future orders. Here we note the dilemma of firms with low or zero profit margins, which are likely to bid on too many bids, thus incurring higher bidding costs than their more profitable competitors.}

To assess the impact of living liver donation (LD) in a diverse and aging population up to 20 y after donation, particularly with regard to medical, financial, psychosocial, and overall health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
Methods
Patients undergoing LD between 1999 and 2009 were recruited to respond to the Short-Form 36 and a novel Donor Quality of Life Survey at two time points (2010 and 2018).
Results
Sixty-eight living liver donors (LLDs) completed validated surveys, with a mean follow-up of 11.5 ± 5.1 y. Per Donor Quality of Life Survey data, physical activity or strength was not impacted by LD in most patients. All respondents returned to school or employment, and 82.4% reported that LD had no impact on school or work performance. LD did not impact health insurability in 95.6% of donors, and only one patient experienced difficulty obtaining life insurance. Overall, 97.1% of respondents did not regret LD. Short-Form 36 survey–measured outcomes were similar between LLDs and the general U.S. population. LLDs who responded in both 2010 and 2018 were followed for an overall average of 15.4 ± 2.4 y and HRQOL outcomes in these donors also remained statistically equivalent to U.S. population norms.
Conclusions
This study represents the longest postdonation follow-up and offers unique insight related to HRQOL in a highly diverse patient population. Although LLDs continue to maintain excellent HRQOL outcomes up to 20 y after donation, continued lifetime follow-up is required to accurately provide young, healthy potential donors with an accurate description of the risks that they may incur on aging.}

We find that institutional investors play a central role in the bid process and can protect minority shareholders from being frozen out in the bid. Specifically, tender offers are less likely to succeed when a firm has institutional investors in its ownership structure. When public-to-private offers are accepted, bid premiums are significantly greater if a financial institution (particularly when it is foreign, independent or activist) has a stake in the firm. We explore the effect of a number of hitherto unexplored factors on the takeover premium and find that shareholder agreements facilitate public-to-private acquisitions. Other factors, such as a threat to merge the target if the bid fails, or external validation of the offer price, have no impact on either the likelihood of delisting or the premium paid by the bidder.}

The model is based on Langefors' theory of rock blasting and the hypothesis that the maximum burden parameter defined by Langefors is a good indicator of BID. We have incorporated the effect of decreased internal energy of the gases as they expand to reach the walls of the borehole and then fitted the model to the available experimental data. Our model involves three easily obtainable parameters, namely, the energy loaded in the borehole, the coupling factor and the rock constant, and the mean gas isentropic expansion factor, which depends on the type of explosive used and on borehole and cartridge diameters. For this factor, we used approximate values independent of the type of explosive. The model indicates that there is a positive relationship between the internal energy of the explosive gases, once they have expanded inside the borehole, and the volume of damaged rock. This relationship is a function of the rock constant, a fundamental rock mass property that defines the maximum extent of damage under predefined charge conditions. The proposed model provides quite acceptable estimates of the fitted data, considering that just a single parameter is incorporated in the statistical procedure: the relationship between maximum burden and BID.}

This paper explores the application of forecasting and statistical learning methods to enhance the competitiveness level of a firm when applying for tenders. On the one hand, time series analysis is used to: (i) forecast the long-term cost of the logistics service; and (ii) construct a ‘risk-aware’ interval for the prices to be offered in the bid. On the other hand, historical data is used to develop statistical learning models. These models are able to predict the probability of success in a given tender based on the actual values of different variables, including the service prices established in the previous stage. Some preliminary results are given, as well as a discussion on how these methods can be integrated into optimization models.}

abstract = {Background: Myelofibrosis (MF) is characterized by poor prognosis, and patients (pts) frequently present with constitutional symptoms, splenomegaly, and anemia. Although ruxolitinib (RUX) is available for the treatment of constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly, therapeutic options for the treatment of anemia are limited. Recent data indicate that immunmodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide or pomalidomide (POM) can improve anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. We designed a multicenter phase-Ib/II combination study of RUX and POM (MPNSG-0212) to evaluate potential synergistic effects in MF. Aims: Based on data from the first 6 pts,we performed a safety assessment to evaluate feasibility and toxicity of combination therapy. Primary study-endpoint is response rate after 12 treatment cycles (28 days each) according to IWG-MRT criteria (Tefferi et al., Blood 2006) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence (Gale et al., Leuk Res 2011). Secondary endpoints are safety, response duration, quality of life, progression-free survival and overall survival. Study Design: Key inclusion criteria are primary or secondary (post-ET / post-PV) MF, anemia with hemoglobin level <10 g/dL, and splenomegaly. Key exclusion criteria are MF pts suitable for allotransplant, platelets <100x10E+9/L, and neutrophils <0.5x10E+9/L. POM is given at a fixed dosage of 0.5 mg QD. RUX was started at 10 mg BID. Dose modifications of RUX were allowed to increase efficacy and to manage myelosuppression. Safety assessment is done after treatment of the first 6 pts for ≥1 cycle. The safety profile is defined favourable if ≤1 of the first 6 pts had a treatment limiting toxicity associated with one of the study drugs (non-hematological toxicity CTCAE ≥°3 and/or hematological toxicity CTCAE ≥°4). Results: Between August 2013 and March 2014, 6 pts were registered. Database lock for the safety analysis was April 22, 2014. Median time on treatment was 4.3 months (range, 1.0-9.4 months). RUX dose was maintained at 10 mg BID in 5 pts, and increased stepwise to 20 mg BID until cycle 6 in 1 pt (ID001). POM was administered continuously. In total, 8 hematological toxicities CTCAE °3 (anemia) were recorded in the 6 pts over the total period of 26 cycles; 3 events already pre-existed before study entry and affected the same pt (ID005). In contrast, anemia increased in 5 pts and made RBC transfusions necessary. However, no CTCAE °4 anemia, no CTCAE °3/4 thrombocytopenia, and no CTCAE °3/4 neutropenia occurred. Study treatment was stopped in 2/6 pts, in ID003 at cycle 3 (cardiac decompensation) and in ID002 at cycle 6 (withdrawal). The following events of non-hematological toxicities CTCAE °3 (n=2) and °5 (n=1) were observed in these 2 pts: 2 SAEs (neuropathy and pneumonia) in ID002 and 1 SUSAR (cardiac decompensation) in ID003 who died during an in-hospital stay. No causal relationship with the study drugs was seen for pneumonia, whereas neuropathy was considered POM-associated. After discontinuation of POM, neuropathy resolved. ID003 was hospitalized for cardiac decompensation with immediate stop of study drugs and died 13 days later. Therefore, causal relationship between study treatment and the SUSAR is unlikely. Three additional unrelated non-hematological adverse events CTCAE °3 occurred in the remaining pts: 1 was pre-existing without aggravation (muscle cramps) and 2 represented MF symptoms not meeting seriousness criteria (musculoskeletal pain, reduced general condition). Conclusion: Based on our safety analysis, the combination therapy was well tolerated. The observed toxicities were within the expected range according to the reported toxicity profiles for the respective single agents and with regard to the general condition of the pts. Therefore, the safety profile of 6 pts treated within the MPNSG-0212 trial was favourably evaluated by the investigators and by an independent data safety monitoring committee. Recruitment of the study continues. An update on safety and first efficacy data will be presented.

We also find that private equity alliances involved more profitable target firms when compared to sole-sponsored private equity deals. Finally, we find that the significantly lower abnormal returns for target firms in private equity alliance deals are eliminated once we control for differences in the types of target firms acquired by private equity alliances and single private equity bidders. The last result suggests that private equity alliances do not generate significantly lower target returns because of collusion.}

Determining optimal bidding strategies in a competitive electricity market to maximize the profit of each bidder is a challenging economic game problem. In this paper, it is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem in which, in the lower level, the community’s social welfare is maximized by solving a power flow problem while, in the upper level, the profits of individual bidders are maximized. In this bidders’ game, instead of using a set of discrete strategies as is usual, we consider continuous functions as strategies. To solve the upper-level problem, two co-evolutionary approaches are proposed and, for the lower level, an interior point algorithm is applied. Three IEEE benchmark problems in four different scenarios are solved and their results compared with those obtained from two conventional approaches and the literature which indicate that the proposed approaches have some merit regarding quality and efficiency.}

However, most studies measure environmental quality using one variable, CO2 emissions. In this study, a more enhanced measure of environmental quality, which incorporates three indicators (per capita CO2 emissions, energy intensity and adjusted national savings), is used. A set of second-generation panel data techniques that address some potentially crucial panel data estimation issues such as cross sectional dependence and cross country heterogeneity, are employed. Data on 24 sub-Saharan Africa countries over the period 1984 to 2016 were analysed. The impact on agricultural productivity of two of the three indicators of environmental quality, namely CO2 emissions and adjusted national savings, has expected signs, negative and positive, respectively. Estimates using different methods suggest a detrimental effect of per capita CO2 emissions on agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. A 1% rise in per capita CO2 emissions induces a 0.04% to 0.06% decline in agricultural productivity. Deteriorating environment quality as a result of climate change is slowly but negatively impacting sub-Saharan Africa agricultural productivity.}

In Ethiopia, open burning of biomass is common practice after harvest and in household cooking, and smoke and improperly discarded AW are also major problems. However, compared with municipal waste management, AWM is poorly addressed. In this study, we seek to assess the current AWM status, farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP), and the factors affecting WTP for eco-friendly AWM in the Mirab Gojjam, Amhara region of Ethiopia, which has not been studied previously. Data were collected through a contingent valuation survey of 353 randomly selected farmers in early spring 2018 (February–April). We offered labour days and money as a payment vehicle. The mean annual WTP is 6.84 labour days (eq 273.50 Birr) and 8.20 Birr in monetary value, respectively. The strongly significant WTP factors are age, education, family size, source of income, land, livestock, and perception. The Tobit results indicate that the bid value in labour days, environmental perception, government subsidy, farm shortage, economic conditions, living in harmony with nature, and knowledge of AW strongly influenced the degree of farmers’ amount to pay. The results are thus useful for understanding farmers’ attitudes towards rural environment quality and WTP for eco-friendly AWM, as well as the need for private and public instruments in AW for developing policies and to turn waste into a resource.}

Our approach to computing equilibria is based on Rosen’s (1974) bid function. It has four desirable features: (i) convergence implies a hedonic equilibrium; (ii) convergence is guaranteed if a hedonic equilibrium exists; (iii) it can solve for a new equilibrium following a shock to the market; and (iv) if multiple equilibria exist, it can identify them. The algorithm is applied to micro data from San Joaquin County, California, where the choice of a home provides access to public schools in particular school districts. First we calibrate the algorithm to approximately reproduce actual housing prices in San Joaquin County as a hedonic equilibrium. Then we introduce a policy that improves school quality in selected school districts. We find that there are several possibilities for the new equilibrium. For each of these potential equilibria, we compare the marginal willingness to pay for school quality with the rate at which the improvement is capitalized into property values. The resulting capitalization rates differ substantially from marginal willingness to pay.}

abstract = {I study the effects of competition in the City of Helsinki bus transit market by conducting two tests for common costs in these first-price sealed-bid procurement auctions. I introduce bidder asymmetry and pooling to the tests. I also discuss the need for robustness checks for some arbitrary choices in these tests. The information environment seems to be that of common costs. The bus companies that have garages close to the contracted routes are influenced more by the common elements than those whose garages are further away. More competition does not necessarily lower procurement costs, and the City should not necessarily implement costly policies to induce more competition. A recent merger of two public companies cannot be criticized from a competition perspective.}

abstract = {In the real-time bidding (RTB) display advertising ecosystem, when receiving a bid request, the demand-side platform (DSP) needs to predict the click-through rate (CTR) for ads and calculate the bid price according to the CTR estimated. In addition to challenges similar to those encountered in sponsored search advertising, such as data sparsity and cold start problems, more complicated feature interactions involving multi-aspects, such as the user, publisher and advertiser, make CTR estimation in RTB more difficult. We consider CTR estimation in RTB as a tensor complement problem and propose a fully coupled interactions tensor factorization (FCTF) model based on Tucker decomposition (TD) to model three pairwise interactions between the user, publisher and advertiser and ultimately complete the tensor complement task. FCTF is a special case of the Tucker decomposition model; however, it is linear in runtime for both learning and prediction. Different from pairwise interaction tensor factorization (PITF), which is another special case of TD, FCTF is independent from the Bayesian personalized ranking optimization algorithm and is applicable to generic third-order tensor decomposition with popular simple optimizations, such as the least square method or mean square error. In addition, we also incorporate all explicit information obtained from different aspects into the FCTF model to alleviate the impact of cold start and sparse data on the final performance. We compare the performance and runtime complexity of our method with Tucker decomposition, canonical decomposition and other popular methods for CTR prediction over real-world advertising datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the improved model not only achieves better prediction quality than the others due to considering fully coupled interactions between three entities, user, publisher and advertiser but also can accomplish training and prediction with linear runtime.}
