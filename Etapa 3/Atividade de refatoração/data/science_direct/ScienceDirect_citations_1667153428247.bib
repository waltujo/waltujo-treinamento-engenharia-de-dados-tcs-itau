abstract = {The controversial re-classification of body dysmorphic disorder with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in the Obsessive-Compulsive Related Disorders chapter of the latest diagnostic statistical manual was based primarily on neuropsychological research and theory. However, little research has examined the extent to which cognitive variables known to be important in the development and maintenance OCD (e.g., “obsessive beliefs”) are related to body image disturbance (BID). The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that obsessive beliefs uniquely predict BID after controlling for other related variables. A total of 601 participants completed a battery of self-report measures of BID severity, obsessive beliefs, OCD symptoms, general distress, and pathological eating attitudes. As predicted, BID was positively correlated with all three obsessive belief domains. Contrary to hypotheses, only the need for perfectionism/certainty obsessive belief domain emerged as a significant unique predictor of BID. Limitations and potential implications for understanding, assessing, and treating BID-related conditions are discussed.}

abstract = {Clinical data mining has great potential for mining hidden patterns in the medical datasets, which can then be used to guide clinical decision making and personalized medicine. While several studies have merged medical data mining techniques with statistical analysis, their proposed mechanisms are excessively complex and are not particularly accurate for individual patients. Therefore, it is essential that a better tool is developed for disease progression and survival rate predictions. In addition, most of the medical datasets are noisy and hence any dataset needs to be cleaned before it is used for predictions. Each dataset may contain many features not all of which are useful for predictions. Therefore, useful feature selection techniques need to be employed before prediction models can be constructed. Furthermore, larger and high quality datasets typically create better prediction models. Thus, in this paper, we explore how data cleaning and feature selection techniques affect the performance of the prediction models. In addition, we develop a new incentive model with individual rationality and platform profitability features to encourage different hospitals to share high quality data so that better prediction models can be constructed. We evaluate our proposed techniques using three datasets and the results show that our proposed methods are more efficient and accurate than several existing prediction models.}

When bidders are asymmetric, we show that level of bid preference that maximizes a seller’s revenues is significantly affected by the degree of selection. We also describe recent empirical and econometric work that shows that the degree of selection can be identified and estimated using standard types of auction data.}

Existing winner determination models tend to ignore bidders’ disruption risks and its dire consequences. This paper particularly studies a revised winner determination problem with disruption risks of bidders for a fourth party logistics (4PL) provider to purchase transportation services via combinatorial reverse auctions. Integrating a hybrid mitigation strategy that includes fortification, reservation and outside option policies to deal with disruptions, a new two-stage stochastic winner determination model is constructed. Based on the characteristics of the deterministic equivalent reformulation, a scenario-based approximation approach is developed as solution method. An upper bound can be obtained by using a scenario reduction approach, and a lower bound can be derived by employing a problem-based relaxation method or an efficient dual decomposition Lagrangian relaxation approach. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model and method, since the gap between the upper bound and lower bound is small. Comparison analysis indicates that our strategy is better than some known strategies, and would have a more significant influence on cost minimization of the 4PL as the probability of disruption becomes higher. Managerial implications are drawn for 4PLs to provide high quality of transportation services under disruptions.}

Objective
To investigate the TrkA inhibitor, ASP7962, for treatment of painful knee osteoarthritis.
Design
Phase 2a, double-blind, placebo- and naproxen-controlled, double-dummy, parallel-group study. Adults with knee osteoarthritis were randomized (2:2:1) to ASP7962 (100 mg), placebo, or naproxen (500 mg) twice daily (BID) for 4 weeks. Primary endpoint: change from baseline to Week 4 in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale score. Secondary endpoints: change from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, and End of Treatment (EoT) in WOMAC pain subscale score; change from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, and EoT in WOMAC physical function and stiffness subscales, walking pain and WOMAC total scores; and change from baseline in daily average pain score.
Results
215 participants were randomized (ASP7962 100 mg BID, n = 85; placebo, n = 87; naproxen 500 mg BID, n = 43). No significant difference was observed between ASP7962 and placebo in change from baseline to Week 4 in WOMAC pain subscale score (−0.14; 90% 2-sided CI: −0.62, 0.34; P = 0.316); a significant difference was observed between naproxen and placebo (−0.67; 80% 2-sided CI: −1.12, −0.23; P = 0.027). No differences were observed between ASP7962 and placebo in change from baseline in any WOMAC subscale score; statistically significant changes were observed between naproxen and placebo (P ≤ 0.01, all time points for all WOMAC endpoints). ASP7962 was safe and well-tolerated.
Conclusions
Four-week treatment with ASP7962 (100 mg BID) did not improve pain or physical function in individuals with painful knee osteoarthritis. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02611466; EudraCT Number, 2014-004996-22.}

To assess the safety and efficacy of cyclosporine A cationic emulsion (CsA CE) 0.1% eye drops in pediatric patients with severe active vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC).
Design
Multicenter, double-masked, randomized controlled trial 8-month safety analysis.
Methods
Of 169 patients (age range, 4-17 years) initially randomized in the 4-month VErnal KeratoconjunctiviTIs Study (VEKTIS), 142 entered the 8-month follow-up period during which CsA CE patients remained on their original regimen (CsA CE 4 times daily [QID, high-dose] or CsA CE twice daily [BID, low-dose] + vehicle BID) and vehicle patients were allocated to one of these 2 active regimens. Main outcome measures were safety, including treatment-emergent adverse events, and efficacy, including corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) score.
Results
Improvements in CFS score, rescue medication use, key VKC symptoms (photophobia, tearing, itching, and mucous discharge), and quality of life (QoL) assessed by QUICK questionnaire observed with CsA CE compared with vehicle during the 4-month evaluation period remained stable during the 8-month follow-up period, with the high-dose regimen continuing to provide greater benefits in most efficacy measures. CsA CE was well tolerated. Treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events during the 12-month study were reported in 15 (20.8%) and 11 (15.7%) of the CsA CE high-dose and low-dose patients, respectively, most commonly instillation site pain (13.9% and 7.1%, respectively). Laboratory data, vital signs, slit lamp examination, best-corrected distance visual acuity, and intraocular pressure raised no safety concerns.
Conclusions
Improvements in keratitis, symptoms, and QoL achieved after CsA CE treatment for 4 months remained stable over the 8-month follow-up period. CsA continued to maintain a favorable safety profile.}

The liquidity basis which is defined as the difference of liquidity between CDS and corporate bond are negative most of the time across different rating categories, implying more illiquid corporate bond market and the fact that CDS market moves quickly in reflecting credit quality changes. There exists significant Granger-causality from CDS liquidity to bond liquidity, and some bidirectional Granger-causality for some investment grade reference entities. The empirical tests are performed in the VAR system including the monetary policy variables and financial market variables. The relative bid-ask spread adopted by many researchers turns out to be less reliable as a measure of liquidity for CDS and corporate bond where the credit spread and liquidity risk are positively correlated.}

Thus, bidders who want to win the auction without too much overbidding have a strong incentive to learn more about the seller's secret reserve price, possibly via their own network of friends, digital networks or online communities. Information sharing and information diffusion in digital networks can change bidding behavior and thus have important implications for sellers in NYOP markets. We develop a decision support system that enables sellers to assess the impact of information diffusion and to analyze the profitability of different seller strategies. We build the system from the bottom up by developing and testing a model of agents' bidding behavior which constitutes the basis for analyzing the effects of different network structures and seller strategies on profit. Sellers can react to information diffusion by setting the secret reserve price optimally, taking into account this strategic element by the provision of a forum and by decreasing the quality of information through forum intervention. Our results show that information diffusion can either decrease or increase seller profit depending on the buyers' initial beliefs about the seller's costs. We also show that the structure of the underlying social network is an important driver for information diffusion and that data about social networks might hence be of value to decision makers.}

To address this, interviews were conducted with 14 expert practitioners in BID to understand how they find and apply cross-domain analogies. Three main themes emerged from the analysis: (1) the skill sets of individual practitioners; (2) the ways they work as part of an interdisciplinary team; and (3) their orientations to biology. These themes present opportunities and challenges for developing analogical design support tools.}

Our results show that after a temporary reduction, prices exceeded both the initial levels and the transitional feed-in tariff. A lack of public acceptance and numerous legal complaints against building permissions have contributed to bids falling below auction volumes in 2018. These results are discussed against the backdrop of the functional and structural promises associated with the introduction of auctions, including reduced remuneration levels, better control of the pace of the capacity expansion and who is able to influence the setting of the remuneration levels.}

The results indicate a positive market reaction, although only for firms that have previously won a highway concession. Based on their experience in winning and operating highway concessions in Portugal, these firms can bid more effectively and present proposals which generate a better value proposition for their shareholders. Accordingly, investors immediately gain from the benefits of the forecast experience and the synergetic gains from operating more than one highway concession. On the opposite, markets react sceptically when the firm starts to operate a highway concession in Portugal. This paper also suggests that markets reward more lengthy contracts positively, as well as if the biding company is not headquartered in the country.}

To assess the cost-effectiveness of basal insulin regimens for adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus in England.
Methods
A cost-utility analysis was conducted in accordance with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reference case. The UK National Health Service and personal and social services perspective was used and a 3.5% discount rate was applied for both costs and outcomes. Relative effectiveness estimates were based on a systematic review of published trials and a Bayesian network meta-analysis. The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used, in which net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated using a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. A wide range of sensitivity analyses were conducted.
Results
Insulin detemir (twice daily) [iDet (bid)] had the highest mean QALY gain (11.09 QALYs) and NMB (£181,456) per patient over the model time horizon. Compared with the lowest cost strategy (insulin neutral protamine Hagedorn once daily), it had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £7844/QALY gained. Insulin glargine (od) [iGlarg (od)] and iDet (od) were ranked as second and third, with NMBs of £180,893 and £180,423, respectively. iDet (bid) remained the most cost-effective treatment in all the sensitivity analyses performed except when high doses were assumed (>30% increment compared with other regimens), where iGlarg (od) ranked first.
Conclusions
iDet (bid) is the most cost-effective regimen, providing the highest QALY gain and NMB. iGlarg (od) and iDet (od) are possible options for those for whom the iDet (bid) regimen is not acceptable or does not achieve required glycemic control.}

We selected 140 inpatients with type 1 bipolar disorder by convenient sampling. Then they completed the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire, Paykel's stressful life events scale and the medication adherence report scale (MARS). Logistic regression analysis showed that bipolar patients with axis I comorbidity are 40 times more likely to attempt suicide than those without axis I comorbidity. The higher the patients’ quality of life, the lower the chance of attempt of suicide. Higher medication compliance reduces the likelihood of suicidal attempt in these patients. And, the increase of stressful life events would raise the risk of suicide attempts, but the relationship wasn't significant. So it can be concluded that quality of life, stressful life events and axis I comorbidity can predict the risk of suicide attempts in patients with type 1 bipolar disorder.}

In addition, the trading volume at market close increased. Further examination of order submission behavior and order imbalance in the closing interval shows that the increase in trading volume at closing is a result of increased market liquidity due to improved transparency. Overall, the introduction of the new closing disclosure rule has effectively enhanced market quality on month-end days.}

Focusing on East and Southeast Asian countries, we find that both performance and corporate governance aspects are relevant in acquisition planning, with preferences relating to pre-acquisition performance of acquired firms differing across domestic and cross-border bidders. We also find that target corporate governance structure at the time of acquisitions is related to post-acquisition performance outcomes. Our findings are robust to a set of tests involving alternative control samples, and any influence of bidder toehold levels. Overall, the paper suggests a role for firm-level corporate governance as an acquisition motive, and a link between corporate governance reform and wider disciplinary attributes of acquisition location decisions.}

By introducing the big data into the forecasting model, the forecasting accuracy can be further improved.

However, it is not easy to obtain a well-behaved RND due to the data limitations, the complex constraints and the ill-posedness of the problem. In this paper, we propose a more effective nonparametric method for estimating the RND from a set of European option bid-ask quotes based on a Linear Programming Support Vector Regression (LPSVR). The method allows us to fit beyond the range of data and to incorporate all the shape constraints, and it thus always gives an arbitrage-free density with full tails. In addition, the method does not need preprocessing of the data and is robust to the bid-ask spread. The Monte-Carlo simulations and the empirical tests have been carried out to demonstrate the excellent accuracy and stability of the method. The results show that the LPSVR method is a promising alternative for estimating the RND.}

abstract = {Non-price attributes such as product quality, supplier’s reliability, and timely delivery can be more important than simply unit price for the buyers. Therefore, the form of supplier competition in which the buyer adjust the prices from the suppliers with the quality scores (QS) becomes more popular than that under price-only format, where the decision is made solely based on prices. That said, QS alters the competition between the suppliers in two ways. First, it changes the nature of price competition among the suppliers as the winner needs to offer the lowest QS-adjusted price (not necessarily the lowest price). Second, the specific value of QS for each supplier is only known to the buyer, which gives rise to the credibility issues from the buyer’s perspective. Analysing supply competition under QS, in this paper, we characterize the equilibrium prices and evaluate whether or not it is beneficial for the buyer to share QS information with the suppliers in a credible fashion. We identify two factors: (i) degree of homogeneity among the suppliers (as measured by relative QS between the suppliers) and (ii) degree of information asymmetry (as measured by the range of uncertainty for the relative QS). The buyer prefers not to share the relative QS with the suppliers if they are relatively similar to each other in terms of QS. This is because the suppliers engage in a more intensified price competition under information asymmetry compared to when they have access to exact value of the relative QS. However, the opposite holds true if the suppliers become more uncertain about their relative QS. Hence, in this case, the buyer finds sharing QS information with the suppliers beneficial for the sake of lowering equilibrium prices notwithstanding the cost of credible sharing.}

Also, there is some evidence that SFAS 157 led to a reduction in bid–ask spread, and we find that quarterly changes in Level 1 and Level 2 fair value net assets are significantly associated with changes in bid–ask spread in 2008 when the spread was rapidly rising, but not in 2009 when it was falling. Our findings suggest that the three-level hierarchy under SFAS 157 provides investors with useful information, and fair value is associated with uncertainty, as measured by bid–ask spread, before and during the financial crisis.}

We find bidders bid rationally: (i) when bidders have a point value but are asked to state an interval bid, they choose to bid as an interval with the point value as the mean of the interval; (ii) bidders who had a value interval but are asked to bid as a point estimate bid the expected value from the interval; and (iii) bidders with an interval value and who bid an interval such that expected bids equate expected values.}

Critics argue that allocations could be abused to generate kickbacks for underwriters while proponents hold that allocation power could improve pre-market price discovery. We examine underpricing, bidding, and allocations from two regimes in the Indian IPO market with varying underwriter allocation power. When underwriters control allocations, bookbuilding is associated with lesser underpricing, but the effect quickly dissipates when regulations withdraw allocation powers. Using proprietary datasets of IPO books in both regimes, we find that allocation powers are used quite extensively. Identical bids can receive significantly different allocations, which depend not only on the bid but also on the bidder identity. When allocation powers are withdrawn, we find evidence of bidder exit, new bidder entry, and altered bidding strategies with exit by both favored and unfavored bidders. Our evidence supports bookbuilding theories in which giving underwriters allocation powers assists in pre-market price discovery.}

Polish public procurement law, harmonized with EU guidelines on the subject, describes selection procedures in detail. Similar procedures are adopted by private sector clients as there exist no private sector specific procurement codes of practice. In the case of public procurement, the bid selection criteria have to refer to the object of procurement and not to the proprieties of a bidder. The client, in order to assure adequate quality of works (i.e. selection of a reliable and capable contractor) can, within the limits enforced by law, set conditions the bidders have to fulfill if they are to participate in a tender or negotiation procedure. The assessment based on criteria related with a bidder's technical and economic capability can be made also at the prequalification stage in restricted tendering procedures. The authors suggest the application of an extended fuzzy AHP method to the process of group decision making. This approach facilitates defining criteria weights by aggregation of decision makers' judgments. The paper presents an example that illustrates this approach to determining criteria weights for bidder assessment. The results show that the proposed fuzzy AHP method is superior to the traditional AHP in terms of improved quality of criteria prioritization.}

Our country-level corporate governance indices capture the changes in the quality of the national corporate governance regulations over the past 15 years. When the bidder is from a country with a strong shareholder orientation (relative to the target), part of the total synergy value of the takeover may result from the improvement in the governance of the target assets. In full takeovers, the corporate governance regulation of the bidder is imposed on the target (the positive spillover by law hypothesis). In partial takeovers, the improvement in the target corporate governance may occur on voluntary basis (the spillover by control hypothesis). Our empirical analysis corroborates both spillover effects. In contrast, when the bidder is from a country with poorer shareholder protection, the negative spillover by law hypothesis states that the anticipated takeover gains will be lower as the poorer corporate governance regime of the bidder will be imposed on the target. The alternative bootstrapping hypothesis argues that poor-governance bidders voluntarily bootstrap to the better-governance regime of the target. We do find support for the bootstrapping effect.}

abstract = {The construction industry is commonly characterized by high level of competition. Since the large majority of the contractors win jobs through the bidding process and the owners predominantly select the contractors, who offer the lowest bid price, estimating the bid price accurately is critical for winning the contract and achieving business continuity. The bid price mainly consists of two components, which are: the base estimate and the bid mark-up. In general, the bid mark-up is estimated as the percentage of the base estimate based on the estimators’ intuitions and past experiences. While the base estimate is found to be more or less same by competitor contractors, the offered bid prices greatly differ due to the variations in the bid mark-up size estimations. The bid mark-up size is affected by several factors. Therefore, determining the appropriate bid mark-up size is a complex decision problem. The main objective of this study is to propose an integrated approach, which may assist contractors in estimating the bid mark-up size more accurately and systematically. The main steps in the proposed approach include: 1) identifying the factors that may affect the bid mark-up size and categorization of these factors and developing a decision hierarchy of the mark-up size estimation problem (i.e., identifying the main criteria and sub-criteria), 2) determining the weights of the main criteria and sub-criteria in the mark-up size estimation problem using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach by top managers considering the long-term strategies of the company, 3) identifying the importance levels of the main criteria and sub-criteria for the projects for which the company management is willing to offer bids, 4) determining the overall risk score of the projects in question by incorporating the weights and importance levels of the main criteria and sub-criteria, 5) estimating the bid mark-up size using the regression analysis, and 6) measuring the performance of the developed regression model. The proposed approach was applied in a contracting company, which is specialized in railway projects. Actual data of 10 railway projects completed in foreign countries within the last five years were collected from the top managers and estimators of the studied company. It was found that the bid mark-up size can be accurately estimated by the proposed approach.}

Increasingly, platforms emerge as facilitators for this kind of collaborative transportation. However, individual actors connected to a platform might refuse to share (parts of) their information due to reasons of competition. Though the need for realistic information sharing models is widely acknowledged by transportation researchers and practitioners, the precise value of such information is mostly unknown. We investigate the quality of solutions that can be obtained when different types and levels of carrier data are available. We consider an auction-based Multi-Agent System to solve large-scale, dynamic pickup and delivery problems, and vary whether carriers’ positions or route plans are available, and whether carriers are fully cooperative or more competitive in placing their bids by sharing or hiding their marginal costs. In total, we evaluate 9 different information sharing policies. The availability of vehicle position and route plan information turns out to be important for decreasing total route costs, and sharing marginal costs has a positive impact on service level. We provide detailed insights into trade-offs of carriers’ confidentiality concerns and a range of system performance objectives (service level, travel costs, and carrier profits) under different circumstances (various numbers of auctions, penalties for rejected orders, emission or congestion fees, and different problem characteristics). Based on these results, platform providers can stimulate sharing of certain information to improve the total system efficiency.}

Because of its size, because buyers have the power to refuse to accept the delivered project, and because all contracts are fixed price, this type of market presents a unique context of software development contracting. We examine this market through the lens of a reverse agency problem. Specifically, we examine how expected project duration and description length affect the amount providers bid and subsequent project success (i.e. that the buyer agreed to pay for it upon delivery). Results show that, as might be expected, projects described at greater length or expected to require more time commanded higher bid prices and were more likely to be successful. However, reviewing the residuals reveals that projects that were eventually unsuccessful were actually bid at higher prices than what they should have been bid at considering their description length and expected duration. Post-hoc analysis suggests that apparently the agents were correct in their relatively higher bidding on the eventually unsuccessful projects because those projects were mostly shorter – and buyers were less accurate in their duration assessment of shorter projects. The risks involved in the possibility that buyers may be signaling wrongly to providers about the project are discussed.}

The impact is heterogeneous: as the auction size increases, low-types decrease effort but high-types increase effort. Additionally, the larger auction provides a stronger rank-correlation between effort and ability, awarding more prizes to the higher-skilled and improving the efficiency of prize allocation.}

Our analysis determines that the target stock price run-up before an announced bid is higher for bidders that are not private equity firms, do friendly acquisitions, are from outside the U.S., rely on newly borrowed funds to finance the acquisition, rely on more investment bank advisors to facilitate the acquisition, and did not previously establish a toehold position in the target.

Bidder 3 is finally chosen as the most suitable contractor for the construction of this project by determining the score matrix and index weight vector of the four bidders concerned. Results have indicated that the aforementioned method is more reasonable and reliable; thus, the bidding evaluation decision is more scientific.}

In contrast, we investigate the impact of fees paid for audit and non-audit services on a market-based measure of disclosure quality and stock market liquidity. Based on a large sample of NYSE-traded S&P 1500 stocks, we find only weak evidence to support the argument that auditor compensation lowers firm disclosure quality and market liquidity. This finding is robust to alternative measures of bid-ask spreads and asymmetric information costs of trading. In addition, we find some evidence to suggest that the adverse effects of auditor compensation on market liquidity are concentrated in firms with weak corporate governance mechanisms. Our results underscore the need to revisit the rationale and scope of restrictions on non-audit services imposed recently by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.}

In particular, their attitudes, knowledge and practices. This study carries out a contingent valuation survey of an urban lake in Košice, Slovakia which suffers from cyanobacterial pollution. The aim of the study is to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for lake water improvement as well as to explore how the WTP is influenced by selected factors. It also aims to analyze the identified positive distance effects on the WTP. Data were collected from a representative survey with a dichotomous choice format. The calculated mean of the WTP showed that respondents would be willing to pay 11 EUR on average each year for improving the water quality of the lake. The study supports the widely shown relationship between WTP and the bid amount, income, use frequency and knowledge. The effects of gender and education are not evident in the study. However, the presence of children in the household had a statistically significant influence on WTP. It was also found that knowledge about the ongoing lake cleaning by the city had a negative impact on WTP. The absence of substitute sites within the city limits and the marginal proportion of non-users in the study could explain the presented positive distance effect. The spatial distribution of frequency of use and knowledge support the traditional distance decay.}

abstract = {Variable renewable electricity (VRE) decarbonises the electricity grid, but its intermittency leads to variations in price, carbon intensity, and curtailment over time. This has led to interest in utilising difficult to manage electricity to produce electrofuels (such as hydrogen via water electrolysis) for transport. The vast majority of the environmental impact of electrofuels is contained in the electricity they consume however, only consuming otherwise curtailed electricity (produced when supply exceeds demand) leads to prohibitively expensive hydrogen due to low run hours. Using a model which bids for wholesale electricity, two operational strategies (controls) aimed at increasing sustainability without requiring policy changes were tested in electricity system models of 40–60% renewable electricity penetration. (1) Bid price control set a maximum price the plant will pay for electricity. (2) Wind forecast control dictated that the plant may only run when a minimum forecast VRE production is met. It was shown that sourcing electricity at times of low cost or high forecast wind power can lead to more decarbonised hydrogen production (up to 56% more) at a lower cost (up to 57% less). When economically optimised (minimising levelised costs) the bid price control reduced the carbon intensity of the electrofuel produced by 5–25%, and the wind forecast control by 14–38%, compared to the grid average. Both controls demonstrated a high proclivity to utilising otherwise curtailed electricity and can be said to aid grid balancing. The bid price control also greatly reduced the average cost of electricity to the plant. The positive impacts increased with renewables penetration, and significant synergies between economic and environmentally conscious operation of the plants were noted. The operational strategies tested in this paper allow for transport fuels to be produced from grid electricity, without exacerbating the mismatch of supply and demand. Future decentralised quasi-storage using these operating strategies may economically produce transport fuel, and aid grid balancing.}

We examine this impact both, in a yearly setting and around the first release of quarterly accrual information. The results of the study provide empirical evidence of a positive association between the adverse selection component and accruals in the yearly analysis. Since wider bid–ask spreads are both theoretically and empirically linked to higher stock returns (Brennan & Subrahmanyam, 1996), our results provide a transaction cost basis for understanding one possible factor underlying the linkage between accruals and cost of equity capital, and accruals and information risk pricing as documented in Francis et al.

A lack of recognition in national planning for biodiversity conservation has resulted in inadequate CWR conservation strategies, particularly in situ. There is little information on in situ conservation costs, and this paper uses a payment for agrobiodiversity conservation services (PACS) approach to estimate the in situ costs of conserving CWR in Zambia, where 30 CWR have been prioritised for conservation (of which nine are present in our sample). Competitive tender bid offers were elicited from farmers willing to accept compensation for providing a CWR conservation service. Using data from 26 communities we determined the on-farm cost of conserving CWR, specifically in field margins/borders. Heterogeneity was evident in farmer bid offers, suggesting discriminatory price mechanisms can potentially deliver cost savings over uniform payment rules. Selection of bid offers under four different conservation goals using a binary linear programming (BLP) model reveals conservation costs ranging from US$ 23 to 91/ha per year. An untargeted area goal provided a least-cost procurement of conservation services ($ 2.3 k per year), followed by a targeted area goal ($ 5.9 k per year). The cost of selecting conservation sites increased when other constraints were added to the BLP model, including those concerning social equity ($ 6.4 k per year), and diversity ($ 9.2 k per year) goals. Overall, the findings suggest the use of competitive tenders, coupled with CWR data and BLP modelling, can potentially add much to improve the efficiency of in situ CWR conservation.}

Socioeconomic changes in Latin American countries have led to an increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined the effects of exenatide twice daily (BID) or insulin lispro, each added to insulin glargine, in Latin American patients with T2D.
Methods
This was a subgroup analysis of patients from Argentina and Mexico in the 4B study (N=114). Patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.0–10.0% (53–86mmol/mol) after 12weeks of intensive basal insulin optimization were randomized to exenatide BID or thrice-daily insulin lispro added to insulin glargine and metformin.
Results
After 30weeks, addition of exenatide BID or insulin lispro resulted in significant (P<0.0001) reductions in HbA1c (exenatide BID: −0.9% [−10mmol/mol]; insulin lispro: −1.2% [−13mmol/mol]). Weight was stable in the exenatide BID group (−0.1kg) and increased significantly (+3.4kg; P<0.0001) with insulin lispro. Major and minor hypoglycemia occurred less frequently (40 vs. 253 events) with exenatide BID compared with insulin lispro. Gastrointestinal adverse events of nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting occurred more frequently with exenatide BID than with insulin lispro.
Conclusions
Both exenatide BID and prandial insulin lispro, each added to basal insulin glargine, were effective at reducing HbA1c in Latin American patients. Treatment with exenatide BID resulted in stable weight but more gastrointestinal adverse events. Treatment with insulin lispro resulted in weight gain and an increased risk of hypoglycemia. These findings support the addition of exenatide BID to insulin glargine as an option for Latin American patients unable to achieve glycemic control on basal insulin alone.}

A buyer employs a Bayesian update mechanism to acquire information from past auction bidding data to formulate his estimation of the expected future price, and thus his procurement decision depends on both his expected future price and the current auction price. The cartel can both increase its profits and mask its presence by manipulating the information transmitted to the buyer. In fact, by employing some informational strategies, the cartel can misinform the buyer and skew the intertemporal procurement decision to its advantage. Finally, we find that imposing a bidding ceiling that exceeds the observed current auction price may be a feasible weapon that allows the buyer to reduce the adverse effects of bidder collusion.}

abstract = {Background and Aims
GERD patients frequently complain of regurgitation of gastric contents. Medical therapy with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) is frequently ineffective in alleviating regurgitation symptoms, because PPIs do nothing to restore a weak lower esophageal sphincter. Our aim was to compare effectiveness of increased PPI dosing with laparoscopic magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) in patients with moderate-to-severe regurgitation despite once-daily PPI therapy.
Methods
One hundred fifty-two patients with GERD, aged ≥21 years with moderate-to-severe regurgitation despite 8 weeks of once-daily PPI therapy, were prospectively enrolled at 21 U.S. sites. Participants were randomized 2:1 to treatment with twice-daily (BID) PPIs (N = 102) or to laparoscopic MSA (N = 50). Standardized foregut symptom questionnaires and ambulatory esophageal reflux monitoring were performed at baseline and at 6 months. Relief of regurgitation, improvement in foregut questionnaire scores, decrease in esophageal acid exposure and reflux events, discontinuation of PPIs, and adverse events were the measures of efficacy.
Results
Per protocol, 89% (42/47) of treated patients with MSA reported relief of regurgitation compared with 10% (10/101) of the BID PPI group (P < .001) at the 6-month primary endpoint. By intention-to-treat analysis, 84% (42/50) of patients in the MSA group and 10% (10/102) in the BID PPI group met this primary endpoint (P < .001). Eighty-one percent (38/47) of patients with MSA versus 8% (7/87) of patients with BID PPI had ≥50% improvement in GERD–health-related quality of life scores (P < .001), and 91% (43/47) remained off of PPI therapy. A normal number of reflux episodes and acid exposures was observed in 91% (40/44) and 89% (39/44) of MSA patients, respectively, compared with 58% (46/79) (P < .001) and 75% (59/79) (P = .065) of BID PPI patients at 6 months. No significant safety issues were observed. In MSA patients, 28% reported transient dysphagia; 4% reported ongoing dysphagia.
Conclusion
Patients with GERD with moderate-to-severe regurgitation, especially despite once-daily PPI treatment, should be considered for minimally invasive treatment with MSA rather than increased PPI therapy. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT02505945.)}

We test the relative propensity of group-affiliated firms, as well as that of standalone (non-affiliated) firms, to finance their investments with stock on the one hand, and either cash or debt on the other. We find that group-affiliated bidders have the greatest propensity to finance their investments with stock when taking over firms affiliated with the same business group (within-group acquisitions), followed by standalone firms making acquisitions (standalone acquisitions). Finally, group-affiliated bidders acquiring either standalone firms or firms not affiliated with their group (outside-group acquisitions) have the lowest propensity to finance their investments with stock. The evidence of higher stock-financing of within-group acquisitions is robust to alternative explanations of tunneling and propping up in business groups.}

Using a sample of 219 cross-border mergers conducted by Chinese listed companies from 2000 to 2013 we document three main results. First, we find that government-affiliated bidder (i.e., those with political connections and/or government ownership) abnormal returns do not differ from non-affiliated bidders in the announcement period after controlling for deal characteristics. However, longer-term post-merger bidder abnormal returns are lower for government-affiliated bidders, consistent with the general inefficiency associated with government-affiliation. Second, our results indicate that improving bilateral political relations between China and target nations are positively associated with both short and long-term bidder performance, indicating a role for economic nationalism in firm outcomes. Third, we find that the interaction between government-affiliation and change in political relations is generally unrelated to bidder performance. However, in target nations with relatively low political risk, the interaction between government-affiliation and change in political relations is positively related to longer-term bidder performance. Thus, government-affiliation can be value enhancing in certain cases.}

abstract = {In spectrum auctions, bidders typically have synergistic values for combinations of licenses. This has been the key argument for the use of combinatorial auctions in the recent years. Considering synergistic valuations turns the allocation problem into a computationally hard optimization problem that generally cannot be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time. Ascending auction designs such as the Simultaneous Multiple Round Auction (SMRA) and the single-stage or two-stage Combinatorial Clock Auction (CCA) can be seen as simple heuristic algorithms to solve this problem. Such heuristics do not necessarily compute the optimal solution, even if bidders are truthful. We study the average efficiency loss that can be attributed to the simplicity of the auction algorithm with different levels of synergies. Our simulations are based on realistic instances of bidder valuations we inferred from bid data from the 2014 Canadian 700 MHz auction. The goal of the paper is not to reproduce the results of the Canadian auction but rather to perform “out-of-sample” counterfactuals comparing SMRA and CCA under different synergy conditions when bidders maximize payoff in each round. With “linear” synergies, a bidder's marginal value for a license grows linearly with the total number of licenses won, while with the “extreme national” synergies, this marginal value is independent of the number of licenses won unless the bidder wins all licenses in a national package. We find that with the extreme national synergy model, the CCA is indeed more efficient than SMRA. However, for the more realistic case of linear synergies, SMRA outperforms various versions of CCA that have been implemented in the field including the one used in the Canadian 700 MHz auction. Overall, the efficiency loss of all ascending auction algorithms is small even with high synergies, which is remarkable given the simplicity of the algorithms.}

A bidder may be indifferent to some items with different brands, specifications or qualities and consider them as substitutable. In this case, these items can be put in a class and hence the bids can be made by referring to the items in such classes. This model enables the bidder to express his requests by using less number of bids in case he does not discriminate between different items. Because of this, we call this problem multi-unit nondiscriminatory combinatorial auction (MUNCA) problem. An integer programming formulation is given for this problem. Since this problem is NP-hard, two fast heuristic algorithms have also been designed. The heuristics give quite good solutions when compared to the optimal solution.}

To investigate levels of depression, quality of life, general health perception, and factors affecting these in grandmothers providing care for their grandchildren.
Material/method
One hundred two family physicians from four cities (Samsun, Amasya, Canakkale, and Izmir) in Turkey investigated 2859 women older than 65 years on their patient lists. Of these, 282 (9.8%) had spent at least 50 h caring for their grandchildren in the previous three months, and these were selected as the study group, while the remaining 2563 (89.6%) were enrolled as the control group. After all participants’ demographic variables had been investigated, they completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Self-Function 12 (Mental and physical component score) (SF-12), and the Visual Analog Scale of EQ-5D (VAS). The participants in the study group also completed a questionnaire investigating features of their grandchild care.
Results
The study group (with the exception of custodial grandmothers) scored better on the SF-12 (PSC = 50.60 ± 6.96 vs 48.24 ± 8.12), (MCS = 49.70 ± 7.77 vs 45.48 ± 7.61), VAS (60.44 ± 23.5 vs 54.16 ± 19.5), and BDI (13.97 ± 0.3 vs 19.49 ± 0.2) compared to the control group (p < 0.0001 for all). Age, monthly income, mean length of education, duration of care, mean hours spent caregiving per week, being a custodial grandmother, presence of more than one chronic disease, and caring for more than one grandchild at a time were identified as factors affecting SF-12, VAS and BID in the study group.
Conclusion
Grandchild care positively affected the grandmothers’ quality of life, depression levels, and general health perception, with the exception of custodial grandmothers.}

In addition, the study evaluated the impact of these treatments on patients' health-related quality of life, measured with both the Functional Living Index—Cancer and the Functional Living Index—Emesis questionnaires. The first dose of study drug was administered 30 minutes before initiation of chemotherapy. Patients received a rescue antiemetic at their request or if the investigator deemed it necessary. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of patients with no emetic episodes over the 3-day study period: 60% in the ondansetron group compared with 21% in the prochlorperazine group. Twenty-five percent of ondansetron-treated patients compared with 68% of prochlorperazine-treated patients experienced three or more emetic episodes, rescue medication use, or withdrawal from the study due to adverse events or lack of efficacy of the study drug. Among patients with at least one emetic episode, the mean time to emesis was significantly longer (13 hours and 37 minutes) in the ondansetron group compared with the prochlorperazine group (9 hours and 30 minutes). Nausea and appetite scores did not differ significantly between groups. The score on the vomiting subscale of the Functional Living Index—Emesis was significantly more favorable in the ondansetron group compared with the prochlorperazine group, indicating better maintenance of health-related quality of life in ondansetron-treated patients. Both treatments were well tolerated. The most common potentially drug-related adverse event was headache, which occurred in significantly more (16%) ondansetron-treated patients compared with prochlorperazine-treated patients (3%). The results of this study demonstrate that oral ondansetron 8 mg BID for up to 3 days is more effective than prochlorperazine 10 mg BID for up to 3 days in the prevention of emesis associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.}

VB inference in combination with recent image models like the ones based on Super Gaussian (SG) and Scale Mixture of Gaussians (SMG) representations have led to the use of very general and powerful tools to provide clear images from blurry observations. In the provided review emphasis is paid on VB inference and the use of SG and SMG models with coverage of recent advances in sampling methods.

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Purpose
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is currently recommended to prevent further ischemic events after percutaneous coronary intervention and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Guidelines currently recommend a minimum of 6 months after elective drug-eluting stent placement and at least 12 months of DAPT after ACS; however, the benefits of prolonged treatment are unclear. The purpose of this review was to conduct a detailed examination of the data refuting or supporting the use of DAPT beyond 1 year in patients with ACS and in patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting.
Methods
A search of PubMed was performed to identify articles published in the last 20 years that addressed the role of DAPT beyond 12 months’ duration.
Findings
A number of studies have shown ischemic benefits associated with prolonging DAPT beyond 12 months, but this finding is dependent on the patient population studied and the quality of the study design. Many studies also show that longer duration therapy has been associated with increased bleeding risk. In patients with previous myocardial infarction completing at least 1 year of DAPT, continuing DAPT with a reduced dose of ticagrelor 60 mg BID is a regimen to be considered for these patients; in general ACS patients, a reduced dose of 60 mg BID of ticagrelor after the first year of DAPT should be considered; and in the post–percutaneous coronary intervention patients, DAPT beyond 1 year should be considered after careful evaluation of the patient's thrombotic and bleeding risks.
Implications
The duration of DAPT, and the choice of P2Y12 inhibitor, should be tailored to the individual patient. To optimize patient outcomes, the benefits and risks associated with prolonging DAPT need to be evaluated, considering comorbidities and the presence of bleeding and ischemic risk factors. Despite some limitations, risk scores, such as the DAPT score, are available to help guide decisions for the best approach for each patient.}

These bidding strategies imply less underpricing in auctions with aggregate pre-auction inventory tilted in one way or the other. We analyze whether a concern for post-auction short squeeze influences observed bidding strategies and auction performance.}

The German regulator decided to sell this spectrum together with spectrum in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz legacy bands. With only the three incumbent operators bidding in the auction and a relatively transparent auction design, it was possible to get a very clear impression of the actual bidding behaviour. We show that in the beginning of the auction, bidders were actively searching for a way to allocate the available spectrum that all bidders could agree to at low prices. Bidders were teaching each other what they should bid and were providing carrots and sticks. When the excess demand was concentrated in one band only, bidders started to compete head on leading to a war of attrition. This competition only stopped when bidders started to raise prices in bands that were already cleared. We interpret this bidding behaviour in terms of bidders expressing allocative externalities and conclude that the ability to do so may be regarded as a positive aspect of the transparent design.}

A joint selection modeling strategy is developed and employed to identify the potential biases in WTP estimations caused by people's ex-ante distrust in local institutions. The results show the various channels through which the distrust in local institutions affects people's WTP between two cities. For one city, the distrust in local institutions significantly increases the probability of one protesting the new program, which results in an underestimation of WTP by 16%. For the other city, the distrust in local institutions leads to a lower estimation of WTP by 26%, mostly via the determination function.}

Winning bid amounts are related to proxies for cash-in-the-market pricing. FDIC loss sharing, not widely used before the recent failure wave, is an important influence on bids.}

Abstract 1164 The three new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran 110mg bid and 150mg bid, investigated in the RE-LY trial, rivaroxaban 20mg od of the ROCKET trial, and apixaban 5mg bid of the ARISTOTLE trial showed equivalent or superior efficacy and safety compared to warfarin in these patients. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis for these NOACs in Germany and compared the quality of life (QALY), incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER), and total costs across those countries form where these data are published. The base case population was a hypothetical cohort of patients 65 years or older with AF who were at increased risk for stroke (CHADS2-score >1) and had no contraindications to anticoagulation. The time horizon was based on the life expectancy of the German population. The QALYs, health insurance costs, and ICER for the NOACs compared with warfarin were calculated for each study. The sensitivity analysis was performed for different base case prices. The Markov decision model was adopted using the TreeAge Pro 2011 program. The data of the outcomes of ischemic stroke and cerebral embolism, major and intracerebral haemorrhage, myocardial infarction, and mortality were taken from the 3 studies comparing the NOAC with INR-adjusted warfarin. Prices for clinical events and for outpatient care were taken from the institute for payment regulations in German hospitals (InEK). The base-case analysis of a 65 years old person with a >2 CHADS2 score using the data from the RE-LY study resulted in 11.41 QALYs for warfarin, 11.53 QALYs for dabigatran 110mg bid, 11.66 QALYs for dabigatran 150 mg bid. ICERs per QALY were 49640€ for dabigatran 110 mg bid and 49590€ for dabigatran 150 mg bid versus warfarin. The same base-case analysis using the data from the ROCKET AF study resulted in 10.79 QALYs for warfarin versus 11.05 QALYs for rivaroxaban. ICERs per QALY were 48980€ for rivaroxaban versus warfarin. The base-case analysis using the data from the ARISTOTLE study resulted and 11.04 QALYs for warfarin versus 11.38 QALYs for apixaban. ICERs per QALY were 49720€ for apixaban versus warfarin. According the Markov Model the daily value based daily prices were 1.25€ for dabigatran 110 mg bid, 2.50€ for dabigatran 150 mg bid, 2.60€ for rivaroxaban, and 3.10€ for apixaban in Germany. The model was highly sensitive to the daily costs for the NOACs but relatively insensitive to other model inputs. Calculating the range of NOAC prices from 0.2 to 10 Euro versus the ICERs dabigatran 110 mg bid produced the highest increase of ICERs over this range of daily costs (Tukey-Kramer test, p<0.05) Comparing these data across countries using the published data shows that the willingness to pay per QALY as well as differences in treatment costs between substantially influences the daily prices of the NOACs. The data demonstrate the necessity to analyse the cost-effectiveness separately for every study due to differences in the INR-adjusted warfarin treated control group. The better the outcome during treatment with warfarin the lower is the benefit of the NOAC. The tendency of the cost-effectiveness calculated by the Markov model is comparable across countries.

We find shared auditors are observed in nearly a quarter of all public acquisitions and targets are more likely to receive a bid from a firm that has the same auditor. Moreover, these shared auditor deals are associated with significantly lower deal premiums, lower target event returns, higher bidder event returns, and higher deal completion rates. These results are driven by bids in which targets and acquirers share the same practice office of an audit firm and in which the target is small. Overall, our evidence suggests that bidders benefit from sharing an auditor with the target. Our results are robust to controls for alternative explanations and for selection bias in the shared-auditor effect.}

In a sample of more than 300 respondents, we find that 54% of the positive bids are rooted to some extent in warm glow reasoning while 29% of the zero bids can be classified as expressions of protest rather than preferences. In previous studies, warm glow bidders are only rarely identified while protesters are typically identified and excluded from further analysis. We test for selection bias associated with simple removal of both protesters and warm glow bidders in our data. Our findings show that removal of warm glow bidders does not significantly distort WTP whereas we find strong evidence of selection bias associated with removal of protesters. We show how to correct for such selection bias by using a sample selection model. In our empirical sample, using the typical approach of removing protesters from the analysis, the value of protecting the wetland is significantly underestimated by as much as 46% unless correcting for selection bias.}

This paper presents a taxonomy of the fraudulent behaviour that can occur while an online auction is in-progress. We examine the perpetrator’s mindset for the following dubious practices: shill bidding, bid sniping, bid shielding, and bid siphoning. We propose the characteristics of such behaviour, the strategies employed, identify the expected pay-off for the perpetrator, and present a novel “Victim Sphere” that outlines who is negatively affected by bad behaviour. We also briefly outline the current state of prevention and detection mechanisms—identifying gaps and open questions where applicable. We contrast the types of undesirable and fraudulent behaviour, describe how they are interrelated, and discuss the challenges researchers face when devising and testing fraud detection/prevention techniques for in-auction fraud. This paper serves as a platform to raise research interest in tackling the remaining challenges for combating in-auction fraud.}

Furthermore, specifying requirements is of importance for both procurer, and potential supplier as it functions as central contractual element between the two. The purpose of the article is to show how functional and non-functional requirements are represented in current call for bids for the procurement of IT. 11 ‘call for bids’ were examined from a Swedish national procurement database. From the analysis of the bids, it can be concluded that the call for bids displays fuzziness in making a clear distinction between functional and non-functional requirements. From the discussion on this, a tentative procurement framework is suggested, aiming on increasing the logical transparency for the procurement of IT.}

The CRP pays farmers to remove chosen plots of land from agricultural production and put them to a conservation use. An interesting aspect of this auction is that winners are determined by a combination of low bids and environmental scores of individual plots. Using decision theoretic approach to model this auction we show that farmers condition their bids on the strength of their environmental scores and that they value environmental benefits, especially those that increase future soil productivity of their land.}

abstract = {Incentive is crucial to the success of mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems. Over the different manners of incentives, providing monetary rewards has been proved quite useful. However, existing monetary-based incentive studies (e.g., the reverse auction based methods) mainly encourage user participation, whereas sensing quality is often neglected. First, the budget setting is static and may not meet the sensing contexts or user anticipation. Second, they do not measure the quality of data contributed. Third, the design of most incentive schemes is quantity- or cost-focused and not quality-oriented. To address these issues, we propose a novel MCS incentive mechanism called TaskMe. An LBSN (location-based social network)-powered model is leveraged for dynamic budgeting and proper worker selection, and a combination of multi-facet quality measurements and a multi-payment-enhanced reverse auction scheme are used to improve sensing quality. Experiments on several user studies and the crawled dataset validate TaskMe's effectiveness.}

After the price limit changes, stock traders alter their order choices significantly by increasing order aggressiveness and decreasing trade size, with the firm-level market quality changing as well. In particular, both time-weighted spread and intraday volatility increase significantly, market depth decreases, and order execution quality (i.e., order duration and fill rate) is enhanced.

Non-generating resources such as large industrial consumers can arbitrage energy prices and provide reserve capacity by exploiting the inherent flexibility in selected industrial processes. A large enough industrial consumer can capitalize on this flexibility through optimized bidding in electricity markets. In this work, the day-ahead cost minimization of a risk-averse pulp and paper mill is formulated as a two-stage stochastic problem, considering thermodynamic and electrical constraints. The bids in the energy and reserve markets are jointly optimized subject to price uncertainty as well as uncertainty of frequency realization. The results of a case study in Sweden display a significant economic benefit in exploiting the flexibility of integrated pulp and paper mills with electric boilers. The expected cost of the pulp and paper mill resulting from different strategies are compared and the risk-aversion of the pulp and paper mill is investigated. Reserve offers are mainly facilitated by fast-acting electric boilers and supported by flexibility in the steam network. We show that reserve offers can significantly improve the profitability of the pulp and paper mill.}

The winner's curse hypothesis posits suboptimal behavior in which winning bidders fail to adapt their strategies to the level of competition and the amount of uncertainty in the takeover environment and predicts that bidder returns are inversely related to the level of competition in a given deal and to the uncertainty in the value of the target. Our measure of takeover competition comes from a unique data set on the auction process that occurs prior to the announcement of a takeover. In our empirical estimation, we control for the endogeneity between bidder returns and the level of competition in takeover deals. Controlling for endogeneity, we find that the returns to bidders are not significantly related to takeover competition. We also find that uncertainty in the value of the target does not reduce bidder returns. Related analysis indicates that prestigious investment banks do not promote overbidding. Analysis of post-takeover operating performance also fails to find any negative effects of takeover competition. As a whole, the results indicate that the breakeven returns to bidders in corporate takeovers stem not from the winner's curse but from the competitive market for targets that occurs predominantly prior to the public announcement of bids.}

In our proposed auction-based waste collection synchronization (A-WCS) mechanism, the carrier plays a role as the auctioneer to decide on who wins the bids and the corresponding payments while the shippers act as the bidders. This is attributed to the carrier-centric structure where a carrier has to consolidate multiple LTL shipping requests so as to provide cost-effective services. Furthermore, a single shipper (e.g., a construction site) may generate multiple types of waste and highly desires for a synchronous service, requiring multiple vehicles dedicated for different waste types to arrive almost simultaneously. The synchronization is beneficial to prevent repeated handling and reduce disruption caused to the minimum. The synchronization requirements are innovatively factored by incorporating time windows into each customer bid. The A-WCS mechanism can encourage truthful bidding from shippers and obtain fair payments for both sides, therefore can benefit the market in the long run. A-WCS problems are extremely difficult to solve due to the integration of two combinatorial problems. We address the A-WCS with a two-layered algorithm, where the variable neighborhood search (VNS) is purposed to search auction allocations in the upper layer and tabu search (TS) is conducted to generate efficient vehicle routes in the lower layer. The capability of our algorithm is demonstrated by an extensive computational study, comparing with a number of state-of-the-art exact and heuristic approaches. Finally, a number of managerial implications for the practitioners are obtained, with insights into the impacts caused by changes in market size, task complexity, customer distribution pattern, and auction frequency.}

abstract = {Introduction
We used European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) data from the LUME-Colon 1 study to illustrate different methods of statistical analysis for health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and compared the results.
Patients and Methods
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive nintedanib 200 mg twice daily plus best supportive care (n = 386) or matched placebo plus best supportive care (n = 382). Five methods (mean treatment difference averaged over time, using a mixed-effects growth curve model; mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM); time-to-deterioration (TTD); status change; and responder analysis) were used to analyze EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS)/QoL and scores from functional scales.
Results
Overall, GHS/QoL and physical functioning deteriorated over time. Mean treatment difference slightly favored nintedanib over placebo for physical functioning (adjusted mean, 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-4.34) and social functioning (adjusted mean, 2.62; 95% CI, 0.66-4.47). GHS/QoL was numerically better with nintedanib versus placebo (adjusted mean, 1.61; 95% CI, −0.004 to 3.27). MMRM analysis had similar results, with better physical functioning in the nintedanib group at all timepoints. There was no significant delay in GHS/QoL deterioration (10%) and physical functioning (16%) with nintedanib versus placebo (TTD analysis). Status change analysis showed a higher proportion of patients with markedly improved GHS/QoL and physical functioning in the nintedanib versus placebo groups. Responder analysis showed a similar, less pronounced pattern.
Conclusion
Analyses of EORTC QLQ-C30 data showed that HRQoL was not impaired by treatment with nintedanib versus placebo. Analysis and interpretation of HRQoL endpoints should consider symptom type and severity and course of disease.}

Sniping is a strategy of placing a bid on an item in the very ending stages of an auction with a pre-determined ending time in an attempt to win the auction. Such a strategy conceals the intentions of the bidder until the last moments of the auction and minimizes the possibility of other opposing bidders submitting higher bids due to the short period of time left to respond. The research includes two field studies and a lab experiment indicating that sniping appears to be influenced by social factors, that is, when there are a greater number of bidders in the auction or the auction site provides social information about the bidders, the relative use of sniping increases. This research supports the perspective that bidders rely on others' bidding behavior and characteristics as an indication of the true value of the item on sale, and is one of the first studies in the literature which takes this perspective.}

Previous experimental auctions have demonstrated that taste is an important factor in determining panelist bid price. Those auctions generally conducted the tasting after providing the explicit product information. Our objective was to determine the relative difference in panelist bidding prices between tasting apple samples before verses after observing displays containing explicit information about the apples. We chose four apple varieties for this study: Honeycrisp, Braeburn, Pink Lady and Red Delicious. Each variety of apple had been grown under two conditions: conventional and organic. A total of 86 panelists participated in one of two information scenarios. Panelists in the first scenario first tasted the apples and placed individual bids for one pound of each of the apple samples. They then viewed information displays (apple name and growing condition) of the apples and placed a second bid. The process was reversed for the panelists in the second scenario in that the information was given before the tasting. When the sensory properties of products were presented before other product information, the impact of the explicit product information was minimized. When product information was presented before the sensory evaluation, it biased the bid prices. To better understand the influence of both the implicit sensory properties and the explicit product information, presentation orders of both types of information should be balanced in an experimental auction.}

Little research has examined the role of self-disgust – a form of disgust that may be particularly relevant to the body. The present study is a descriptive analysis of the association between BID and self-disgust, controlling for other related variables. Two non-clinical samples completed measures of BID, self-disgust, negative affect, anxiety sensitivity, disgust propensity, and disgust sensitivity. Although BID was associated with all three forms of disgust at the bivariate level, in multivariate analyses self-disgust emerged as a unique predictor of BID, above and beyond all included variables, although effect sizes were small. Potential implications for understanding, preventing, and treating body image-related disorders are discussed.}

Following an agent-based modeling approach, the two most commonly applied auction pricing rules are compared (uniform and pay-as-bid) and first conclusions on outcomes are drawn for future policy design. The auctions are modeled to closely represent the auction design foreseen in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG, 2017) and replicate their parameters. The analysis draws on auction theory. For both pricing schemes, individually rational agents with independent valuation are assumed. As support for renewable electricity through auctions is to be established permanently and auction rounds will be held multi-annually, a further focus lies on agents learning over time by adapting their behavior to new information. The model results show that pay-as-bid exhibits lower prices and thus support costs than uniform pricing, whereas allocative efficiency suffers under pay-as-bid. Over time, one can observe a decline in the strike price, which is due to learning effects, whereas agents' profits increase in the course of the auctions. Furthermore, smaller actors will experience difficulties and agent diversity is likely to suffer in the long term, if this is not accounted for in other ways.}

We argue that the choice of the bidder is influenced by the fact that the merge with a firm that belongs to an investment style more popular with the market may boost the bidder's value. By using data on the flows in mutual funds, we construct a measure of popularity, which relies directly on the identification of sentiment-induced investor demand, rather than being a direct transformation of stock market data. We show that differences in popularity between bidder and target help to explain their pairing. The merger with a more popular target generates a halo effect from the target to the bidder that induces the market to evaluate the assets of the less popular bidder at the (inflated) market value of the more popular target. Both bidder and target premiums are positively related to the difference in popularity between the target and the bidder. However, the target's ability to appropriate the gain is reduced by the fact that its bargaining position is weaker when the bidder's potential for asset appreciation is higher. We document a better short- and medium-term performance of less popular firms taking over more popular firms. The bidder managers engaging in these cosmetic mergers take advantage of the window of opportunity induced by the deal to reduce their stake in the firm under convenient conditions.}

In addition, the study evaluated the impact of these treatments on patients' health-related quality of life, measured with both the Functional Living Index—Cancer and the Functional Living Index—Emesis questionnaires. The first dose of study drug was administered 30 minutes before initiation of chemotherapy. Patients received a rescue antiemetic at their request or if the investigator deemed it necessary. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of patients with no emetic episodes over the 3-day study period: 60% in the ondansetron group compared with 21% in the prochlorperazine group. Twenty-five percent of ondansetron-treated patients compared with 68% of prochlorperazine-treated patients experienced three or more emetic episodes, rescue medication use, or withdrawal from the study due to emesis or adverse events. Among patients with at least one emetic episode, the mean time to emesis was significantly longer (13 hours and 37 minutes) in the ondansetron group compared with the prochlorperazine group (9 hours and 30 minutes). Nausea and appetite scores did not differ significantly between groups. The score on the vomiting subscale of the Functional Living Index—Emesis was significantly more favorable in the ondansetron group compared with the prochlorperazine group, indicating better maintenance of health-related quality of life in ondansetron-treated patients. Both treatments were well tolerated. The most common potentially drug-related adverse event was headache, which occurred in significantly more (16%) ondansetron-treated patients compared with prochlorperazine-treated patients (3%). The results of this study demonstrate that oral ondansetron 8 mg BID for up to 3 days is more effective than prochlorperazine 10 mg BID for up to 3 days in the prevention of emesis associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.}

abstract = {Urban forest parks, such as Fuzhou National Forest Park (FNFP), provide residents with landscape amenities, recreational opportunities, and interaction with nature. Understanding the recreational quality of green spaces and visitors’ behaviors and preferences is essential for effective forest park conservation strategy. We aimed to assess the recreational use and amenities of FNFP and calculate the monetary value of provided services using a contingent valuation method (CVM). A total of 249 park visitors were interviewed face-to-face based on a questionnaire using entrance fee as the payment vehicle, in October 2015 and January 2016. A considerable number of protest responses may cause selectivity bias; consequently, we used models excluding protest zeros. Sample selection models were estimated using Heckman’s two-step and full information maximum likelihood methods The average willingness-to-pay (WTP) was estimated to be 13.79 RMB (equivalent to 2.00 USD) for the unconditional model, and the lower mean values were estimated for two selectivity bias corrected models. In this case, park visitors would be willing to pay an average 11.6 RMB (equivalent to 1.69 USD) per person according to the full information maximum likelihood estimate and an average 10.96 RMB (equivalent to 1.60 USD) per person by the two-step method. Respondents’ satisfaction of forest park facilities and service significantly influenced their WTP value for forest park improvements. Socio-demographic features could not effectively discriminate the protest bidders and the other non-protest bidders. Our results suggest that protesters may value the resource less than positive bidders. The high percentage of protest respondents may be due to the current free use of FNFP and payment vehicle of entrance fee. The CVM approach takes residents’ preferences into consideration and allows the study of heterogenous socio-demographic groups; thus, our data may help to develop effective management plans for improving urban forest parks in China.}

abstract = {In collaborative logistics, carriers form coalitions in order to perform parts of their operational business jointly. Combinatorial auctions can be used to exchange transportation requests without having to reveal critical information. Collaborators submit requests for exchange to a common pool. The requests in the pool are then grouped into bundles either by the auctioneer or by the carriers themselves, and offered for auction. While in the literature it is mostly assumed that both bundling and bidding is done by the carriers, our study shows that bundles built by the auctioneer under incomplete information can yield significantly higher collaboration profits, and allow for a lower number of bundles to be generated. However, even if the number of traded bundles is decreased by only offering some promising auctioneer bundles, the carriers have to present their bids for all the offered bundles. Typically, a bid is based on the carrier’s marginal profit. Hence, for each bid, an NP-hard routing problem has to be solved. To decrease this enormous computational effort, we develop different approximate bidding strategies. We show that for the single vehicle case, very simple bidding strategies are sufficient: they allow to reduce the computational time of the auction process by an order of magnitude, with no significant loss in collaboration profit. For multiple vehicles, however, our research shows that more sophisticated bidding strategies are recommended. Finally, we introduce a new profit sharing method, which is computationally tractable, guarantees individual rationality and does not require that critical information is revealed.}

Biologically inspired design (BID) is one of the most commonly employed design strategies. However, few studies have examined the BID of context-aware smart products to date. This paper presents a structured design framework to support the BID of context-aware smart products. The meaning of context-awareness is defined from the perspective of product design. The framework is developed based on the theoretical foundations of the situated function–behavior–structure ontology. A structured design process is prescribed to leverage various biological inspirations in order to support different conceptual design activities, such as problem formulation, structure reformulation, behavior reformulation, and function reformulation. Some existing design methods and emerging design tools are incorporated into the framework. A case study is presented to showcase how this framework can be followed to redesign a robot vacuum cleaner and make it more context-aware.}

We find positive abnormal returns for the domestic bidders during 2007–2014, thereby implying that the domestic bidders earn more wealth than the cross-border bidders. Additionally, we find that abnormal returns are higher after the dotcom bubble period of 1997–2002: in particular during the period 2007–2014 for short-term domestic performance. We also find supportive evidence that cash-rich bidders required high-tech targets to seize growth opportunities, and consequently earned high abnormal returns.

abstract = {Introduction
Twice-daily radiation with concurrent chemotherapy is recognized as the standard of care for the treatment of limited stage small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), but its utilization in this setting is unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze modern patterns of treatment for limited stage SCLC and the impact on survival utilizing the National Cancer Database.
Methods
Between 1999 and 2012, there were 25,045 patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic SCLC who met the selection criteria, of whom 22,626 had survival data. Those receiving 45 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions twice-daily (BID) were compared with those receiving 45 to 72 Gy in 1.8 or 2.0 Gy fractions. Overall survival was analyzed via Kaplan–Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify covariates associated with survival.
Results
The utilization of BID radiation overall was 11.3%. Treatment at an academic center was associated with a higher likelihood of receiving BID treatment (odds ratio: 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.95–2.69; p < 0.001). Median survival was 22.1, 17.2, 18.3, 19.2, and 19.5 months for patients receiving 45 Gy BID, 45 Gy once-daily, 46 to 59.4 Gy once-daily, 60 to 61.2 Gy once-daily, and 62 to 72 Gy once-daily, respectively (p < 0.001 for all pairwise comparisons to BID). On multivariate analysis, treatment at an academic center (hazard ratio: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.83–0.93; p < 0.001) and receipt of BID radiation (hazard ratio: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86–0.98; p = 0.008) were associated with improved survival.
Conclusions
The adoption of BID radiation remains very limited, but is more commonly utilized in the academic setting. In this hospital-based study, BID fractionation was associated with improved survival over once-daily fractionation, even at doses ≥60 Gy.}

We examine the price performance and efficiency properties of split-award auctions under asymmetric information. In equilibrium, both award outcomes can occur: the split-award outcome arises only when it minimizes total costs; sole-source outcomes, however, occur too often from an efficiency viewpoint. Equilibrium bids involve pooling at a common price for the split award, and separation for sole-source awards. We provide conditions under which the buyer and suppliers all benefit from a split-award format relative to a winner-take-all unit auction format. Model predictions are assessed with data on submitted ‘step-ladder’ bid prices for a U.S. defense split-award procurement.}

However, a rising share of renewable technologies requires their integration into this market in order to assure future grid stability. Due to the high market complexity, operators and traders of such technologies are currently lacking a tool to estimate earning potentials. Both a market prediction methodology as well as a bidding strategy are required to estimate the earning potentials and to participate in the aFRR market. To encourage participation of new technologies, this paper first provides a detailed market description and then presents a market prediction methodology for estimating revenue potentials and to assist in creating bidding strategies for auction participation. For any potential bid, the acceptance probability within the auction is derived. Both statistical and machine learning based models are used for predicting key market quantities.

abstract = {Purpose
Dalfampridine extended-release (ER) tablets 10 mg BID have been approved for use in improving walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). This subgroup analysis evaluated the effects of dalfampridine ER 5 and 10 mg BID on distance walked, as assessed using the 6-minute walk (6MW) test.
Methods
This analysis of data from a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (N = 430) included only the 153 patients with 6MW data available. Participants (aged 18–70 years) were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive dalfampridine ER 5 or 10 mg or placebo, BID for 4 weeks. The 6MW was used for assessing walking distance at baseline and 2 weeks after the start of treatment at the 26 study sites that were able to perform this test. Participants were administered the 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), a patient-reported measure of the impact of MS on walking. Post hoc outcomes included the percentages of patients who achieved an increase from baseline in 6MW distance of ≥20% and who achieved a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) from baseline in 6MW distance, defined as ≥+55 m. Changes from baseline in walking speed (MSWS-12) were compared, stratified by subgroup that achieved ≥20% versus <20% improvement on the 6MW. The correlation between change in walking speed over time and subgroup (by change in distance walked) was evaluated. The tolerability of dalfampridine was assessed based on the prevalence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
Findings
In the post hoc analysis, the percentage of patients with an improvement in 6MW distance that met or exceeded the MCID was significantly greater with dalfampridine ER 10 mg BID relative to placebo (37.3% vs 12.2%; nominal P = 0.004). Similarly, the percentage with an improvement in 6MW distance of ≥20% was significantly greater with dalfampridine 10 mg BID relative to placebo (45.1% vs 14.3%; nominal P < 0.001). Regardless of treatment allocation, improvement in MSWS-12 was significantly greater in the subgroup that achieved a ≥20% improvement on the 6MW compared with the subgroup with <20% improvement (mean changes, –15.5 vs –7.2; nominal P = 0.041). The prevalences and types of TEAEs were consistent with those reported in previous studies.
Implications
Based on the MCID for 6MW, the use of dalfampridine ER 10 mg BID but not 5 mg BID was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in walking relative to placebo. The correlation between improvement on MSWS-12 and the 20% increase in 6MW distance suggests that an improvement on MSWS-12 is clinically relevant. These results, although highlighting a lack of efficacy of dalfampridine ER 5 mg BID, suggest that the 10-mg BID dose is effective for improving walking speed, as observed on short timed-walk tests, and for increasing distance walked over longer timed-walk periods.

We test the disagreement hypothesis, which posits that disagreement causes investors to be less certain about their revaluation of acquiring firms, making bidder returns less informative. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find an inverse relation between bidder returns, which proxy for the degree of disagreement, and the change in the bidders' implied volatility. Also consistent with the hypothesis, we find that the significant inverse relation between bidder returns and the change in implied volatility holds only for cases of negative bidder returns. We test for alternative explanations of this relation, but continue to find robust support for the disagreement hypothesis. Finally, the relation between bidder returns and the likelihood of deal completion is stronger when announcement returns are more informative, suggesting managers “listen to the market” more when the market response is more informative.}

abstract = {Objective
Excitotoxic injury involving N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hyperactivity contributes to epilepsy-related memory dysfunction (ERMD). Current treatment strategies for ERMD have limited efficacy and fail to target the underlying pathophysiology. The present pilot study evaluated the efficacy of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, for the treatment of ERMD in adults with focal-onset seizures.
Methods
Subjects underwent cognitive testing at baseline, after a 13-week randomized, parallel-group, double-blinded phase (of memantine titrated to 10 mg bid or placebo), and following a 13-week open-label extension phase (of memantine titrated to 10 mg bid). The selective reminding test (SRT) continuous long-term retrieval (CLTR) score and 7/24 Spatial Recall Test learning score served as the primary outcome measures. Secondary measures included tests of attention span, fluency, visual construction, and response inhibition, as well as assessments of quality of life, depression, sleepiness, and side effects.
Results
Seventeen subjects contributed data to the blinded phase (n = 8 memantine, n = 9 placebo). No significant differences were seen between groups on the primary or secondary outcome measures. Pooled data at the end of the open-label phase from 10 subjects (initially randomized to memantine n = 3 or placebo n = 7) demonstrated statistically significant improvement from baseline in CLTR score, memory-related quality of life, spatial span, and response inhibition. No significant changes were evident in depression, sleepiness, side effects, or seizure frequency throughout the trial.
Significance
Results demonstrated no significant effect of memantine on cognition when assessed at the end of the blinded period. Pooled data at the end of the open-label phase showed significant improvement over baseline performance in measures of verbal memory, frontal-executive function, and memory-related quality of life. These improvements, however, may be due to practice effects and should be interpreted cautiously. Findings suggest a favorable safety profile of memantine in the setting of epilepsy.}
