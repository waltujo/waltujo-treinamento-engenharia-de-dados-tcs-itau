abstract = {Due to the explosive growth of mobile data traffic, it has become a common practice for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs, also known as operators or carriers) to utilize cellular and WiFi resources simultaneously through mobile data offloading. However, existing offloading technologies are mainly established between operators and third-party WiFi resources, which cannot reflect users dynamic traffic demands. Therefore, MNOs have to design an effective incentive framework, encouraging users to reveal their valuations on resources. In this paper, we propose a novel bid-based Heterogeneous Resources Allocation (HRA) framework. It can enable operators to efficiently utilize both cellular and operator-own WiFi resources simultaneously, where the decision cost of user is strictly controlled. Through auction-based mechanisms, it can achieve dynamic offloading with awareness of users valuations. And the operator-domain offloading effectively avoids anarchy brought by users selfishness and lack of information. More specifically, HRA-Profit and HRA-Utility, are proposed to achieve the maximal profit and social utility, respectively. addition, based on Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit model, the newly proposed HRA-UCB-Profit and HRA-UCB-Utility are able to gain near-optimal profit and social utility under incomplete user context information. All mechanisms have been proven to be truthful and satisfy individual rationality, while the achieved profit of our mechanism is within a bounded difference from the optimal profit. In addition, the trace-based simulations and evaluations have demonstrated that HRA-Profit and HRA-Utility increase the profit and social utility by up to 40% and 47%, respectively, compared with benchmarks. And the cellular utilization rate is kept at a favorable level under the proposed mechanisms. HRA-UCB-Profit and HRA-UCB-Utility restrict pseudo-regret ratios under 20%.}

It attempts to understand the Quantity Surveyors' (QS) estimation accuracy in relation to public projects. This study analyses 83 projects of estimates and tender bids. The analysis includes three (3) estimating targets i.e. lowest bid, accepted bid and mean of the bids. To broaden the study, 344 QS involved in the procurement answered the questionnaires. Linear multiple regression analysis on project characteristics shows that project size, number of bidders, location and type of schools affect the bias. Contract period affects the consistency. The use of mean of the bids is the best-fit target to explain the bias in terms of adjusted R2. The accuracy may improve if sufficient design information is available, proper cost planning and improving the application of historical cost data. As an alternative, the phenomenon of overestimation is resulted from government directive instruction, which could challenge the rational of accurate estimate.}

Sellers can post ask prices to attract buyers through a process of directed search, but ex post there is the possibility of negotiation. Similarly, buyers can advertise negotiable bid prices to attract sellers. Even when transaction prices often differ from quoted prices, bid and ask prices play a crucial role in directing search and reducing trading frictions. The theory endogenizes the direction of search and provides insight about the prevalence of posted prices in the absence of full commitment by market participants to transact at the advertised price.}

abstract = {With the high penetration of renewable energy, such as hydro, wind and solar, curtailment is a serious issue in some regions, such as China. The key issue is lacking of flexibility, primarily due to the limited dispatchable range of thermal generators. There is an urgent need to expand the dispatchable range to promote the renewable energy accommodation. To this end, a new constraint relaxation-based day-ahead market mechanism is proposed. The trade-off between thermal units and renewable energy is achieved. Deep ramp offers and curtailment relief bids are proposed to express market participants’ willingness for deep ramp and relieving curtailment. Thermal units submit their deep ramp offers to get compensation while renewable energy submits its curtailment relief bid to cut the energy price. Renewable energy is curtailed in the order of its curtailment relief bid. The model of constraint relaxation-based day-ahead market clearing procedure and model of equal curtailment without constraint relaxation are formulated, respectively. An accelerating technique combining Relaxation-based Neighborhood Search (RBNS) and Improved Relaxation Inducement (IRI) is introduced. A case study based on IEEE 118-bus system validates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism and models and shows that the introduced accelerating technique can significantly reduce the computation time.}

abstract = {The preprocessing pipelines of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) were made publicly available for the neuroimaging community to apply the HCP analytic approach to data from non-HCP sources. The HCP analytic approach is surface-based for the cerebral cortex, uses the CIFTI “grayordinate” file format, provides greater statistical sensitivity than traditional volume-based analysis approaches, and allows for a more neuroanatomically-faithful representation of data. However, the HCP pipelines require the acquisition of specific images (namely T2w and field map) that historically have often not been acquired. Massive amounts of this ‘legacy’ data could benefit from the adoption of HCP-style methods. However, there is currently no published framework, to our knowledge, for adapting HCP preprocessing to “legacy” data. Here we present the ciftify project, a parsimonious analytic framework for adapting key modules from the HCP pipeline into existing structural workflows using FreeSurfer's recon_all structural and existing functional preprocessing workflows. Within this framework, any functional dataset with an accompanying (i.e. T1w) anatomical data can be analyzed in CIFTI format. To simplify usage for new data, the workflow has been bundled with fMRIPrep following the BIDS-app framework. Finally, we present the package and comment on future neuroinformatics advances that may accelerate the movement to a CIFTI-based grayordinate framework.}

abstract = {The recent financial crisis brought upon a period of increased information uncertainty for firms and market agents and in the context of mergers and acquisitions, increased information asymmetry between bidders and targets. This led to an overall increase in average acquisition premiums. However, the final realized premium can be moderated through CEO characteristics in dealing with such issues as uncertainty and asymmetry. Bidder CEOs can reduce these premiums through their expertise, networks and control: powerful CEOs will tend to pay smaller premiums than weaker CEOs because they are better equipped to deal with the increased information uncertainty and asymmetry, either through risk-averse behavior or better assessment of target quality. Our results based on a six-year sample of S&P500 firms engaged in M&A activity, and centered on the onset of the recent financial crisis, largely support our predictions. While earlier research suggested that CEO power could lead to higher premiums, our study points to the opposite conclusion: during times of financial crisis, CEO power effectively constrains premiums. This extends our understanding of why bidder CEOs overpay beyond the role of bidder anchoring bias, hubris, and target resistance by considering the role of macro-environmental conditions and power.}

abstract = {Background
In medical patients, it is unclear whether thromboprophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be administered bid or tid.
Methods
This study was a mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis of randomized control trials that enrolled hospitalized nonsurgical patients at risk for VTE and compared UFH bid, UFH tid, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to one another or to an inactive control subject. DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), major bleeding, and death were measured. A Bayesian framework using a random-effects model was applied.
Results
Sixteen trials with moderate methodologic quality enrolling 27,667 patients contributed to this analysis. The relative risk and 95% credible intervals comparing UFH tid to UFH bid for DVT, PE, death, and major bleeding were 1.56 (0.64-4.33), 1.67 (0.49-208.09), 1.17 (0.72-1.95), and 0.89 (0.08-7.05), respectively. When compared with either dose of UFH, the use of LMWH has an effect similar to UFH on all four outcomes.
Conclusions
Moderate-quality evidence suggests that subcutaneous UFH bid and UFH tid do not differ in effect on DVT, PE, major bleeding, and mortality. Either of the two dosing regimens of UFH or LMWH appears to be a reasonable strategy for thromboprophylaxis in medical patients. A future randomized trial comparing the two doses of UFH is very unlikely, considering the very large sample size that would be required to demonstrate a significant difference, which, if it exists, is undoubtedly small.}

We find that the bid-ask spread prior to earnings announcements dates is significantly higher than that of post earnings announcements, suggesting that asymmetric information has driven the increase in liquidity skewness. We also find that the effect of earnings announcements is more pronounced in the 2007 global financial crisis, consistent with the notion that extreme market downturns amplify asymmetric information. Our overall evidence also implies that increased competition and transparent trading environments limit market makers' abilities to cross-subsidize bid-ask spreads between periods of high and low levels of asymmetric information.}

While twice-daily (BID) and three-times-daily (TID) dosing regimens have been studied, the two have never been directly compared. We performed a metaanalysis to assess whether TID is superior to BID dosing in the prevention of VTE. Methods:Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from 1966 through December 2004 were searched for randomized trials comparing subcutaneously dosed UHF (either BID or TID) with placebo or control for VTE prophylaxis in medical patient populations. Two reviewers independently rated study quality on the basis of predetermined criteria. Data were extracted on patient age, hospital setting, comorbidities, VTE rates, and bleeding complications. Results:Twelve studies were identified; 7,978 patients (1,664 patients in the TID arm, and 6,314 patients in the BID arm) were included. After adjustment for baseline risk, there was no difference in the overall rate (per 1,000 patient-days) of VTE (BID, 5.4; vs TID, 3.5; p = 0.87). TID heparin showed a trend toward a decrease in pulmonary embolism (PE) [BID, 1.5; vs TID, 0.5; p = 0.09] and in proximal DVT and PE (BID, 2.3; vs TID, 0.9; p = 0.05). The risk for major bleeding was significantly increased with TID heparin (BID, 0.35; vs TID, 0.96; p < 0.001). Conclusions:BID heparin dosing causes fewer major bleeding episodes, while TID dosing appears to offer somewhat better efficacy in preventing clinically relevant VTE events. Practitioners should use underlying risk for VTE and bleeding to individualize pharmacologic prevention.}

This latter format is supposed to prevent an unreliable low bidder from winning the auction; as a consequence cost overruns should be lower under the average bid than under the first price format. We test this hypothesis with a panel data set of auctions held in the Italian Veneto region between 2004 and 2006, including small size public projects in sectors such as road works and building maintenance. We find that cost overruns are lower under the average bid format, but only when the entry is restricted. We then speculate on possible explanations for this result.}

Transient institutions react more positively to corporate disclosure quality during market downturns than during normal market periods, as better disclosure practices lower information asymmetry and are thus associated with reduced uncertainty, enhanced liquidity, and weakened impacts of crises, which are the most desirable features of assets during market downturns. Dedicated institutions are insensitive to corporate disclosure quality in both normal and market downturn periods, as they have access to inside information and rely less on public disclosures. Their reliance on corporate disclosures in market downturns, however, increases sharply after the implementation of Regulation Fair Disclosure, which removes their inside information advantage. We further show that corporate disclosure reduces information asymmetry to a greater extent in market downturns than in normal market periods and that transient ownership in market downturns provides strong price support and stabilizes return volatility, whereas dedicated ownership does not possess such functions. Finally, we show that the results are not simply driven by endogeneity and are robust to alternative corporate disclosure quality measure and to the control of other determinants of institutional holdings.}

Reaction time is introduced as an essential non-economic factor of model bidding behaviors in these car license auctions. At the theoretical level, this paper finds that reaction time causes inefficient allocations in the Shanghai auction, but not in the Singapore or Guangzhou auctions. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that late bids prevail in all of these auction formats, but only lead to inefficient allocations in the Shanghai auction. Additionally, the subjects' reaction time in the Shanghai treatment was scored by conducting a number comparison task, finding a positive correlation between the probability of winning and the reaction time score.}

Second, we also examine the deal characteristics of CSR firms and find that they choose deal features such as cash payment, domestic targets, and single bids. Third, we show that socially responsible firms are more likely to pay a lower bid premium when they pay for acquisitions. Finally, we find that the announcement period abnormal return is positive and significant when CSR-oriented bidding firms announce an acquisition decision in the market.

We suggest an evolutionary hypothesis according to which women are predisposed by hormones to generally behave more riskily during their fecund phase of their menstrual cycle in order to increase the probability of conception, quality of offspring, and genetic variety.

Specifically, the double auction scheme is successfully implemented by the general assignment game algorithm (GA-alg), in which D2D pairs and spectrum resources act as sellers and bidders in each auction round, respectively. Additionally, social ties between users are determined by interaction data and the Kullback–Leibler divergence language model based on sentiment classification. Finally, simulation results not only illustrate that the proposed double auction scheme can achieve an optimal solution with lower complexity, but also demonstrate the effect of social ties on D2D communications.}

abstract = {Optimizing the participation of a large number of prosumers in the electricity markets is a challenging problem, especially for portfolios with thousands or millions of flexible resources. To address this problem, this paper proposes a cluster-based optimization approach to support an aggregator in the definition of demand and supply bids for the day-ahead energy market. This approach consists of two steps. In the first step, the aggregated flexibility of the entire portfolio is computed by a centroid-based clustering algorithm. In the second step, the supply and demand bids are defined by an optimization model that can assume the form of a deterministic or a two-stage stochastic problem. A case study of 10,000 prosumers from the Iberian market is used to evaluate and compare the performance of the bidding optimization models with and without pre-clustering. The numerical results show that the optimized bidding strategies outperform an inflexible strategy by more than 20% of cost savings. The centroid-based clustering algorithm reduces effectively the execution times of the bidding optimization problems, without affecting the quality of the energy bids.}

We propose a Sieve Maximum Likelihood Estimator (SMLE).

In an application to timber auctions we find that the bidders are risk-neutral, but we would reject risk-neutrality without accounting for unobserved auction heterogeneity.}

However, the potential direct and indirect impact of childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) on PSU remains largely unexplored, despite the established role of CEM in the onset of other excessive, problematic, and addictive behaviors. Consequently, the purpose of the present study was to test the direct and indirect relationships of emotional abuse and neglect (two facets of CEM) with PSU via specific mediational pathways including body image dissatisfaction (BID), social anxiety, and depression. The sample comprised 443 adolescents who completed a questionnaire that included assessment tools of aforementioned variables. Multiple mediation model results indicated that CEM was directly and indirectly associated with PSU via BID, depression, BID-related depression, and BID-related social anxiety. Results suggested that emotionally traumatic experiences were associated with PSU in adolescents and that this relationship may partially be explained by BID and psychosocial risk factors. The present study draws caution to the amplifying roles of CEM and BID on increased PSU. The results of the study have important clinical and public health implications, but additional research is needed before interventions can be developed and implemented on the basis of present results.}

Cross-sectional analysis using pharmaceutical firms reveals a negative association between disclosure quality and bid–ask spreads (both the total spread and its adverse-selection component), but no association between disclosure quality and either market depth or the ex ante cost of equity capital. Overall, our findings provide some evidence of benefits accruing to pharmaceutical firms that comply with the FASB's recommended voluntary disclosures under the assumption that lower bid–ask spreads reduce the cost of capital and strong evidence that complying with FASB's recommended disclosures provide a direct benefit to small investors, those who bear the entire weight of bid–ask spreads.}

abstract = {One of the factors differentiating public transport operators the most in bus services is, arguably, the respective location, and thus distance from, their workplaces to the area of a procured contract. Sub-optimal depot locations relative the lines run result in disadvantages in knowledge about the contract and the risk of running unpaid (or dead running) bus kilometers, leading to higher costs and/or less revenue and could affect an operator’s probability to participate in tenders. As previous studies have discussed, this is a relevant competitive factor, but the transport literature lacks studies aiming to assess the size of this distance factor. This paper examines what impact operators’ distance to tendered bus contracts has on their probability to participate in the tender, and how this probability differs across operator types. To address this, an econometric analysis was undertaken using probit regressions with data on tendered Swedish bus contracts over the period 2007–2015 along with operator workplace data. The results show that operators’ distance from a contract has a significantly negative effect on their probability of placing a bid for the contract. While being located near the contract gives, on average, an over 90 percent probability of participating, being 10 km away results in some 30 percent probability. The rival’s distance to the contract also has an effect, but only to a limited extent. Large operators are found to be less affected by their distance to a contract, and they are also more inclined to bid if the procuring authority offers a depot to use.}

At each visit, infants played with objects in the presence of their caregivers as crawlers or walkers. Previously, we found that HR infants are less likely to share their object play with caregivers at walker ages. The present study found that caregivers of HR infants used greater directive bids including being more proximal to infants and using greater verbal and non-verbal bids to sustain their infant’s attention and to ensure their compliance during the task compared to caregivers of LR infants. Our study emphasizes the bidirectional and dynamic nature of infant-caregiver interactions. Our findings have implications for caregiver training programs that teach parents appropriate strategies to promote early social communication skills in at-risk infants.}

Currently, concentrations of particulate matter in these cities frequently reach dangerous levels. Urban afforestation represents an alternative to increase human health in arid cities via air-filtering and dry deposition. By simulating a non-existing market through a contingent valuation protocol, this study estimates the willingness to contribute monetarily to an urban afforestation scenario in Mexicali –an arid city located at the US-Mexico border. We estimate an average annual willingness to pay (WTP) of (2019) USD 88 per household. Variations in WTP are associated with the respondent’s perception of air quality and the presence of respiratory symptoms in the respondent’s household. The smallest WTP (USD 75) is reported by those perceiving poor air quality in their neighborhood and with no household members affected by respiratory symptoms. Respondents perceiving good air quality and with at least one household member facing respiratory symptoms report a WTP of USD 99. The highest WTP represents around 0.8 % of the annual household income. This WTP, when extrapolated to and aggregated over the total number of households in Mexicali, justifies the implementation of an urban afforestation program supplying 30 thousand tree seedlings annually.}

In addition, we investigate the short-term wealth effects of 2821 European mergers and acquisitions initiated by large and medium-sized European firms. We find that, upon announcement, domestic acquiring firms earn higher abnormal returns than cross-border bidders. Domestic bidders’ outperformance holds even when controlling for different bid and firm characteristics such as method of payment, type of transaction, public status of the target firm, and activity relatedness of the target and the bidder. We find larger short-term wealth effect of foreign firms bidding on Continental European targets than those of foreign firms acquiring companies in the UK/Ireland. Our analysis shows that cross-border bidding firms tend to experience lower announcement returns when targets are located in countries with stronger investor protection mechanisms, suggesting that acquirers must compensate target firm shareholders (that is, pay higher premiums) if the quality of the corporate governance is reduced.}

abstract = {BIDs were introduced in the UK in 2003/2004 and their widespread adoption is linked to their ability to raise funds to invest in the locality, through a mandatory supplementary levy on business rates, voluntary contributions, sponsorship and public sector grants. However, the economic downturn has already restricted those sources of funding, and public sector spending cuts are likely to restrict them even further. This paper discusses a case-study research on the impact that recession and spending cuts have had on the way BIDs operate, and identifies the threats and opportunities to them as stakeholder-led instruments for the management of town centres and commercial and industrial areas. The research shows that although the recession and spending cuts have had an impact on most BIDs, the model itself has not been put in question, and BIDs are becoming permanent features of the governance of town and city centres, and increasingly also of industrial areas. Their roles in public realm management have been varied, from a minor function in complementing local environmental services, to being active players in the transformation of public places into arenas for festivals and spectacle, to coordinators of surveillance, policing and occasionally exclusion. The implications for the public realm of the evolution and consolidation of BIDs will therefore be varied. Some BIDs are likely to play an increasing role in the delivery of public realm services and the shaping of public realm quality, and in those cases the existence of adequate mechanisms to harmonise the interests of levy payers with other local stakeholders will be of considerable importance. Others might have a sporadic impact on the public realm, with a more pronounced role of the local authority in mediating that impact. Understanding how BIDs operate, the aspirations they represent, their relationship to other aspirations and to broader policy objectives, and the role in that operation of fluctuations in the economy, will be increasingly important in thinking critically about the limits and potential of emerging forms of urban governance.}

abstract = {Objective
For patients who have received a kidney transplant, studies have shown that once-daily prolonged-release tacrolimus (TAC) has similar efficacy and safety to standard twice-daily dosing. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and safety of daily TAC (TAC qd) versus standard twice-daily TAC (TAC bid) administration in liver transplantation (LT).
Design
Meta-analysis.
Setting and participants
We systematically searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for studies comparing outcomes of LT patients who received TAC qd versus TAC bid.
Outcome measures
Results were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs.
Results
Six studies, which included 5179 LT recipients (TAC qd = 951; TAC bid = 4228) were included in the analysis. The TAC qd group had a low 1-year graft loss rate (OR 0.70 [95% CI 0.54–0.91], P = 0.008) and lower rate of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) at 90 days (OR 0.46 [95% CI 0.24–0.89], P = 0.02) compared with the TAC bid group. There was no significant difference in 1-year mortality or the incidence of adverse events after LT between the 2 groups.
Conclusions
Current evidence suggests that TAC qd is safe and effective for LT patients during the first year after transplantation. Longer-term follow-up studies are necessary to determine if TAC qd is safe and effective beyond the first year after LT.}

Lower market liquidity indicates higher levels of information asymmetry implying that market participants perceive financial statement misstatement risk is higher. If SOX disclosures contain relevant information, then one would expect firms reporting internal control material weaknesses to have lower market liquidity. Accordingly, we find that market liquidity is lower (i.e., bid-ask spreads are higher) for firms reporting ineffective control compared to firms reporting effective control using either annual SOX 404 internal control reports or quarterly SOX 302 disclosure control reports, which suggests that SOX 302 and 404 reports provide useful information for identifying firms with a higher risk of financial statement misstatement. However, we do not find consistent results using two alternative liquidity measures: trading volume and market quality indices. We then examine whether changes in control reports are associated with changes in market liquidity. We generally do not find that firms with improved (deteriorated) control reports experience a larger decrease (increase) in bid-ask spreads or larger increases (decreases) in trading volume and market quality indices compared to other firms, suggesting that market participants do not discern a change in information asymmetry when the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting changes.}

We use quarterly data of bilateral interbank credit exposure among all German banks from 2000 to 2008 to measure interbank relationships and network characteristics. We match these data with bids placed by individual banks in the European Central Bank’s (ECB) weekly repo auctions. The bids measure each bank’s willingness to pay for liquidity, since they had variable rate tenders with a “pay-your-bid” price. Controlling for bank characteristics and the daily fulfillment of reserve requirements, we find that banks with a more diversified borrowing structure in the interbank market bid significantly less aggressively and pay a lower price for liquidity in the ECB’s main refinancing operations. These findings suggest that incentives to diversify banks’ liquidity risk dominate the benefits of private information. When the network position of the bank is taken into account, we find that central lenders in the money market bid more aggressively in auctions.}

abstract = {This paper studies the effects of pre-trade quote transparency on spread, price discovery and liquidity in an artificial limit order market with heterogeneous trading rules. Our agent-based numerical experiments suggest that full quote transparency incurs substantial transaction costs to traders and dampens trading activity in an order-driven market. Our finding reveals that exogenous restriction of displayed depth, up to several best quotes, does not benefit market performance. On the contrary, endogenous restriction of displayed quote depth, by means of iceberg orders, improves market quality in multiple dimensions: it reduces average transaction costs, maintains higher liquidity and moderate volatility, balances the limit order book, and enhances price discovery.}

This paper examines the issue of competitive environment within public works contracts and explores the influence of the number of bidders on the tender results. A research sample of 256 public tenders was investigated in order to evaluate two research hypotheses. Data evaluation was supported by interval plot, scatter plot and correlation analysis. It has been found that the number of bidders in the tender depends on the type of the subject matter of the tender; however, this difference does not have a significant impact on the level of competition. Another research finding supports the assumption that the number of bidders influences the relative difference between expected price and award price. It was concluded that contracting authorities must not only require a sufficient range of qualifications, but should also take any steps required to motivate a sufficient number of applicants to participate in the tender procedure to achieve competitive prices.}

abstract = {The shift towards renewable energies is accompanied by great volatility on the supply side, demanding European-wide instead of national balancing services. For the integrated European procurement of balancing reserves, the European Commission proposes a multi-attributive auction mechanism which is very similar to the current German auction. The key difference, however, is a switch from pay-as-bid to uniform pricing. We develop a game-theoretical model of the current German and the future European balancing market design. Both market designs have desirable economic properties in their one-shot version, i.e., an efficient auction outcome and competitive prices. We show that a switch to uniform pricing does not induce bidders to report their true costs in their bids, but leads to underbidding. We contrast the equilibrium outcomes with German market data and find a substantial discrepancy, i.e., non-competitive prices. We provide a game-theoretical grounded explanation that is based on the regular repetition of the auction combined with the invariant supplier side.}

In this study, samples of rough long grain rice were infested with R. dominica at several rates (0, 20, and 200 adults/kg). The effects of these infestations on rice quality and quantity were measured objectively using color and milling yield. They were also measured subjectively with a blind taste/sensory consumer taste test and a non-hypothetical auction measuring consumer willingness to pay for the different qualities of rice. The objective quantity and value loss ranged from 2% for lightly-infested rice to 3.5% for heavily-infested rice. For subjective effects, results of the auction suggested that participants on average were willing to pay only a small premium for less infested rice. This test confirmed results of the sensory taste panel, which showed that participants on average detected very little difference among rice samples with alternative levels of infestation. However, when they were given extra information verifying that rice with lower infestation levels was higher quality or that the rice was stored using IPM methods, the potential price increase from reducing R. dominica infestation could range from $0.44/kg. to $0.79/kg., plus a $0.13/kg. premium for using IPM storage methods. However, results suggest that in order to capture that value rice sellers must be able to convey information about quality and storage attributes to consumers in a way that is relevant and trustworthy.}

We present a series of learning and pricing models for repeated GSP auctions selling multiple heterogeneous items. This paper contributes to the literature in dynamic pricing with learning and complements the existing off-line studies on impact of the reserve price in the multi-billion dollar online advertising business. With few restrictions on the distribution function of the unknown parameter, algorithms are developed to estimate the empirical distribution function and determine the best reserve price to reduce the revenue loss (regret) over time. When bidders bid in the locally envy-free equilibrium, we present an algorithm that has the best attainable regret upper bound. When bidders do not bid in the locally envy-free equilibrium, we propose a GSP auction with position-specific reserve prices and develop an algorithm with the same regret bound to mitigate the risk of strategic bidding. With a high volatility involved, learning becomes more active while earning is more effective. When bidders coordinate bidding, the properly selected starting reserve prices can substantially reduce the revenue loss from possible collusive bidding behaviors.}

abstract = {Background
Improvements in disease free survival for epithelial ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer (EOC) will only come with improved primary therapy. Incorporation of poly-ADP-ribose inhibitors (PARPi) in the frontline setting may represent one strategy. This study sought to determine the maximum tolerated and feasible doses of the PARPi veliparib in combination with chemotherapy for EOC.
Methods
A phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation evaluated dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in cycles 1–2. Once <2/6 patients experienced a DLT, that dose level expanded to evaluate feasibility over 4 cycles. This study opened 10/2009 and closed 8/2016. Eligible patients had untreated, stage II-IV EOC. Veliparib was added either continuous (day 1–21) or intermittent (day - 2 to 5) during 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Three chemotherapy backbones were evaluated (2 intravenous (q3week and weekly) and 1 intraperitoneal (IP)) all inclusive of bevacizumab with and as maintenance to 22 cycles.
Findings
Dose evaluations for 424 treated patients were available. Regimen 1 (q3 week), continuous (Reg1c) the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 250 mg veliparib BID and feasible dose was 150 mg BID. For regimen 1, intermittent (Reg1i) the MTD and feasible dose were 400 and 250 mg BID. For Reg2c (weekly paclitaxel) the MTD and feasible dose were 150 mg BID. For Reg2i the MTD and feasible dose were 250 and 150 mg BID. For Reg3c (IP) the MTD and feasible dose were 150 mg BID and for Reg3i (IP), the MTD and feasible dose were 400 mg and 300 mg BID.
Interpretation
The feasible dose for Reg1c, 2c, 2i and 3c was 150 mg po BID. For Reg1i and 3i the dose was pushed to 250 and 300 mg po BID respectively. There is no apparent difference in efficacy between continuous and intermittent dosing indicating that the higher doses achieved in intermittent dosing may not be needed. (NCT00989651).

We also find that bidders engaging in asset purchase transactions experience significantly more favorable valuation effects than those that acquire the equity of target firms.}

In order to test this distinctive comparative statics prediction, we develop an experiment where subjects bid in multiple auctions for real objects as well as auctions with induced values, each time facing a different number of rivals. Our results are broadly consistent with expectations-based reference-dependent preferences and loss aversion. We find that in real-object auctions bids decline with the intensity of competition whereas in induced-value auctions, instead, bids do not vary with the intensity of competition. Our results suggest that bidders may behave differently in real-object auctions than in induced-value ones, casting some doubt on the extent to which findings from induced-value laboratory experiments can be transferred to the field.}

Trading activity measures such as volumes or number of transactions increase stronger for bigger than for smaller stocks, while spreads increase more for smaller firms than for bigger ones. These findings enrich the understanding of liquidity dynamics especially on the emerging markets where liquidity is an important price formation factor.}

In line with the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, we present a Human Connectome Study Related to Human Disease that is intentionally designed to generate and test novel, biologically-motivated dimensions of psychopathology.

This sample constitutes a dataset uniquely situated to elucidate relationships between brain circuitry and dysfunctions of the Negative Valence construct of the RDoC framework. We present a comprehensive overview of the eligibility criteria, clinical procedures and neuroimaging methods of our project. After describing our protocol, we present group-level activation maps from task fMRI data and independent components maps from resting state data. Finally, using quantitative measures of neuroimaging data quality, we demonstrate excellent data quality relative to a subset of the Human Connectome Project of Young Adults (n = 97), as well as comparable profiles of cortical thickness from T1-weighted imaging and generalized fractional anisotropy from diffusion weighted imaging.

Theoretically, we find that the symmetric bidding equilibrium is unique unless returns are free, and when returns are free there exist multiple equilibria with different implications for sellers. Moreover, more generous return policies mitigate the winner's curse, but also push the bids higher, thus hurting bidders by eroding their surplus. In the experiment, bids increase and bidders' earnings decrease with more generous return policies as predicted. With free returns, many bidders bid above the highest possible value, subsequently returning the item regardless of value. Though consistent with equilibrium behavior, this is not optimal for sellers.}

We also observe that purchases have a greater impact on permanent price changes. Once price effects are estimated using quote returns to eliminate the bid-ask bias, the asymmetry in buyer and seller initiated trades is dramatically reduced. Our results suggest that the bid-ask bounce can explain asymmetry in the trading direction of zero-leverage firms when they encounter debt for the first time.}

To describe the changes in endothelial cell density (ECD), the coefficient of variation (CV), and the percent of hexagonal cells (%HEX) after 3 months of therapy with netarsudil (Rhopressa; Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc, Durham, NC) 0.02% dosed once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) and to compare these changes with those seen with timolol 0.5% BID in eyes with ocular hypertension (OHTN) or open-angle glaucoma (OAG).
Design
Post hoc analysis of data from a phase 3 evaluation of the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy and safety of netarsudil 0.02% versus timolol 0.5%.
Participants
A subset of study subjects underwent corneal endothelial cell imaging by specular microscopy at baseline and after 3 months of therapy.
Methods
Images were evaluated in a masked fashion at an independent reading center. The ECD, CV, and %HEX were determined using a standardized protocol for image analysis.
Main Outcome Measures
Changes in ECD, CV, and %HEX from baseline to 3 months were compared between treatment groups using 2-sample t tests.
Results
Data from 386 subjects from whom analyzable specular microscopy images were obtained at both baseline and month 3 were included in this analysis. Mean ECD, CV, and %HEX values were comparable between groups at baseline. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in changes from baseline to month 3 in ECD, CV, or %HEX between either of the netarsudil groups and the timolol group. Within groups, CV declined in a statistically significant fashion from baseline to month 3 in all 3 groups by 1.4% to 2.1% (P < 0.001), and %HEX increased by a statistically significant amount (0.7%, P = 0.030) in the timolol group. These small changes were unlikely to be of clinical significance. No statistically significant changes in ECD were seen in any group.
Conclusions
Netarsudil 0.02% showed no clinically significant effects on ECD, CV, or %HEX when dosed QD or BID for 3 months in eyes with OHTN or OAG.}

Thus, when bidders are opportunistic, the fraction of stock in the deal payment will be lower for better informed targets. We test this intuitive prediction against the alternative that stock payments primarily reflect bidder concerns with target adverse selection, which implies a greater fraction of stock in the deal payment for better informed targets. Discriminating between these two mutually exclusive and nested predictions requires measures of target information about the bidder but not of market mispricing. We find that public bidders systematically use more stock in the payment when the target knows more about the bidder. Tests exploiting exogenous variation in bidder market-to-book ratios also fail to support bidder opportunism. Finally, greater potential competition from private bidders is associated with greater propensity for public bidders to pay in cash.}

This paper proposes a synergistic control strategy for data center frequency regulation which uses both IT and cooling systems. It combines power management techniques at the server level with control of the chilled water supply temperature to track the regulation signal from the electrical market. A frequency regulation flexibility factor is also proposed to increase the IT capacity for frequency regulation. The performance of the control strategy is studied through numerical simulations using an equation-based object-oriented Modelica platform designed for data centers. Simulation results show that with well-tuned control parameters, data centers can provide frequency regulation service in both regulation up and down. The performance of data centers in providing frequency regulation service is largely influenced by the regulation capacity bid, frequency regulation flexibility factor, workload condition, and cooling mode of the cooling system, and not significantly influenced by the time constant of chillers. In addition, compared with a server-only control strategy, the proposed synergistic control strategy can provide an extra regulation capacity of 3% of the design power when chillers are activated. When chillers are deactivated, both strategies have a similar regulation capacity.}

We argue that the most common method, price-to-quality scoring, is inappropriate for several reasons. It is non-transparent, making accurate representation of the procurer's preferences difficult. It is often open to strategic manipulation, due to dependence on irrelevant alternatives, and it tends to impose particular and unjustified non-linearity in bid prices. The alternative quality-to-price scoring method, where money values are assigned to different quality levels, is a better alternative. However, when the cost of quality is relatively well-known and several providers can offer optimal quality, lowest price is the preferable supplier selection method, while beauty contests may be preferred when purchasing budgets are inflexible.}

abstract = {Diffusion MRI tractography processing pipeline requires a large number of steps (typically 20+ steps). If parameters of these steps, number of threads, and random seed generators are not carefully controlled, the resulting tractography can easily be non-reproducible and non-replicable, even in test-test experiments. To handle these issues, we developed TractoFlow. TractoFlow is fully automatic from raw diffusion weighted images to tractography. The pipeline also outputs classical diffusion tensor imaging measures and several fiber orientation distribution function measures. TractoFlow supports the recent Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format as input and is based on two engines: Nextflow and Singularity. In this work, the TractoFlow pipeline is evaluated on three databases and shown to be efficient and reproducible from 98% to 100%, depending on parameter choices. Moreover, it is easy to use for non-technical users, with little to no installation requirements. TractoFlow is publicly available for academic research and is an important step forward for better structural brain connectivity mapping.}

abstract = {If bidders are uncertain about their value when they participate in an auction, they may overbid and suffer ex-post losses. Limited liability mitigates these losses, and may result in more aggressive bidding and higher seller revenue, but also in an inefficient allocation. Using a combination of theory and experiment, we analyze three different forms of liability in second-price auctions: full liability, limited liability by default with varying penalties, and resale-based limited liability. With a default penalty, bids are higher than under full liability, but final revenue and efficiency are lower due to the frequency of default. Auctions with resale result in the highest revenue and allocative efficiency, and are as effective as a low default penalty in alleviating bidders’ losses. Hence, allowing resale as a form of limited liability may be preferred by both bidders and sellers over other liability rules.}

The goal of our research was the trace quantification of BTEX in water by using a new simple, low-cost, and accurate method, based on headspace (HS) extraction and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to barrier ionization discharge detector (BID). This water application dealt with simple matrices without protein, fat, or humic material that adsorb target analytes, thus the external standard calibration was suitable to quantify each compound. The validation steps included the study of linearity, detection and quantification limits, and accuracy. LODs and LOQs varied from 0.159 to 1.845 μg/L and from 0.202 to 2.452 μg/L, respectively. The recovery was between 0.74 ± 0.13 and 1.15 ± 0.09; relative standard deviations (% RDSs) were less than 12.81% (n = 5) and 14.84% (n = 10). Also, GC performance was evaluated in term of efficiency, peak tailing and resolution. Preliminary results from practical applications to analyses of real samples are presented. The results indicate that static HS coupled to GC–BID is a successful method for BTEX analysis in water samples at the μg/L levels, provided that hydrocarbons interference occur at similar concentration levels. GC-BID may become a routine reference method alongside the official analytical techniques for quality control purposes of contaminated waters. Moreover, the new method is amenable to automation by using commercial HS units.}

abstract = {Research on bidder collusion in procurement auctions is reasonably successful in unveiling the mechanisms of collusion among the bidders. But it is relatively weak in forwarding effective practical methods of collusion detection before the winner is declared, because they presuppose the knowledge of collusion in specific auctions. Past studies, however, point out the need for working with bid price-to-reserve price ratios rather than bid prices or winning bid prices, to be free from the problem of heteroscedasticity. They also draw an important inference that the set of collusive data are significantly different from the set of competitive data. On the basis of these basic facts, the current paper outlines a seven-step approach to collusion detection. The approach makes rudimentary statistical analysis of bid price-to-reserve price ratios for all the bidders. The analysis comprises tests of equality of means, medians and variance and tests of skewness, autocorrelation and normality of the ratios. It divides the ratios into two significantly different clusters. The cluster with the higher mean and variance values of the ratios corresponds to collusive bidding with the other cluster corresponding to competitive bidding. The paper proposes the construction of a process control chart to detect occurrence of collusion in an auction immediately after the price bids are opened. The approach is illustrated by applying it to data from procurement auctions for construction projects in a State Department of the Republic of India.}

First, using the bid construction model, competing suppliers determine their suggestions regarding the unit prices, quantities, and delivery times of relief items as well as the most appropriate transportation modes. Afterwards, the CP runs the bid evaluation model to assess the submitted bids by which the best portfolio of suppliers and their allocated orders are determined. An illustrative numerical example inspired by a real practice is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed decision models. Several sensitivity analyses are also conducted on key parameters from which useful managerial insights are drawn.}

In this paper we propose a possible reason for the existence of inefficient mergers, which is based on search and information frictions. Our model examines three such frictions: target’s obsolescence risk, difficulties in evaluating complementarity gains, and competitive interaction among potential bidders in output markets. We test the model’s predictions using two established measures of complementarity gains in mergers: product similarity and technological overlap. Both sets of tests indicate that the degree of inefficiency in observed M&As is related to targets’ and bidders’ characteristics in ways consistent with the model’s predictions. More generally, our results suggest that search and value discovery are important determinants of merger outcomes.}

In many MCS scenarios it is desirable to give micro-payments to contributors as an incentive for their participation. However, to further encourage participants to use the system, one important requirement is protection of user privacy. In this work we present a multi-attribute reverse auction mechanism as an efficient way to offer incentives to users by allowing them to determine their own price for the data they provide, but also as a way to motivate them to submit better quality data. Our auction protocol guarantees bidders' anonymity and suggests a new rewarding mechanism that enables winners to claim their reward without being linked to the data they contributed. We have analyzed our protocol and showed that it offers strong security and privacy guarantees in all phases of the auction process, from bidding to rewarding. Additionally, we have implemented the protocol using off-the-shelf cryptographic primitives; our experiments show that the protocol is scalable, it can be applied to a large class of auctions and remains efficient from both a computation and communication point of view so that it can be run to the users' mobile devices.}

Background
The effects of inhaled steroids upon the quality of life of patients with bronchiectasis remain unknown.
Study objective
To analyze the effect of inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP) for 6 months upon the clinical, functional, microbiological and outcome parameters of patients with steady-state bronchiectasis not due to cystic fibrosis, and its repercussions for patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
Design
Prospective, randomized, double-blind (for effective doses) study.
Patients and interventions
The diagnosis of bronchiectasis was made by high-resolution computed tomography. Ninety-three patients (mean age: 68.5 [8.4]) were randomized to receive 250μg bid, 500μg bid or no treatment with inhaled FP for 6 months. Data were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. HRQoL was assessed using the validated Spanish version of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire.
Results
The group administered FP 1000μg daily showed significant improvement in dyspnea (1.03 [2.1]−1.24 [2.2] points; P=0.01–0.04), sputum production (P=0.001), days without cough (P=0.02) and short-acting beta-2 agonists used (P=0.01) from the first month of treatment, with no changes in pulmonary function, number or severity of exacerbations, or microbiological profile of the sputum. As a result, an improvement in HRQoL was seen in this group after 3 months of treatment (45.4 [14.2] vs. 40.5 [13.9]; P=0.01).
Conclusions
Inhalatory FP 500μg bid is effective from the first month of treatment for controlling the symptoms of patients with steady-state bronchiectasis—thus ensuring a significant improvement in HRQoL.}

Background
Tofacitinib and other new treatments approved for use in psoriatic arthritis have only recently been included in psoriatic arthritis treatment guidelines, and studies evaluating the relative efficacy of available therapies are important to inform treatment decisions by healthcare professionals.
Objective
To perform a network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of tofacitinib, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), and apremilast in patients with psoriatic arthritis naïve to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy (TNFi-naïve) or with an inadequate response (TNFi-IR).
Methods
A systematic literature review used searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and The Cochrane Library on October 9, 2017. Randomized controlled trials including adult patients with psoriatic arthritis receiving treatment administered as monotherapy or with conventional synthetic DMARDs were selected. Efficacy outcomes included American College of Rheumatology 20 response, change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, ≥75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, and change from baseline in Dactylitis Severity Score and Leeds Enthesitis Index. Treatment effects were evaluated during placebo-controlled phases, using a binomial logit model for binary outcomes and a normal identify link model for other outcomes. Discontinuations due to adverse events and serious infection events were assessed as safety outcomes.
Results
The network meta-analysis included 24 published randomized controlled trials, of which 13 enrolled TNFi-naïve patients only, 3 enrolled TNFi-IR patients only, and 8 enrolled both TNFi-naïve and TNFi-IR patients. Placebo-controlled treatment durations ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. Indirect comparisons showed tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID to have similar efficacy compared with most bDMARDs and apremilast in improving joint symptoms (based on American College of Rheumatology 20 response), and with some bDMARDs in improving skin symptoms (based on Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) (tofacitinib 10 mg BID only in TNFi-IR) in patients with psoriatic arthritis who were TNFi-naïve or TNFi-IR. Results also showed that, compared with placebo, the improvement in physical functioning (based on Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index) with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID was similar to that observed with most bDMARDs and apremilast in TNFi-naïve patients, and similar to that observed with all bDMARDs with available data in the TNFi-IR population. Improvements in Dactylitis Severity Score and Leeds Enthesitis Index scores were comparable between treatments. Tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID were median-ranked 8 and 15, respectively, for discontinuation due to any adverse events, and 5 and 16, respectively, for a serious infection event out of a total of 20 treatments in the network (lower numbers are more favorable).
Conclusions
Tofacitinib provides an additional treatment option for patients with psoriatic arthritis, both in patients naïve to TNFi and in those with TNFi-IR. (Curr Ther Res Clin Exp. 2020; 81:XXX–XXX)}

Difficult-to-control asthma has been associated with gastroesophageal acid reflux. Acid-suppressive treatment has been inconsistent in improving asthma control.
Objective
To determine whether a proton-pump inhibitor improves asthma control in adult asthmatic patients with acid reflux symptoms.
Design
Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
Setting
Twenty-nine private practices and 3 academic practices in the United States.
Patients
Two hundred seven patients receiving usual asthma care including an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Patients had acid reflux symptoms and moderate-to-severe persistent asthma.
Intervention
Lansoprazole, 30 mg bid, or placebo, bid, for 24 weeks.
Measurements
The primary outcome measure was daily asthma symptoms by diary. Secondary asthma outcomes included rescue albuterol use, daily morning and evening peak expiratory flow, FEV1, FVC, asthma quality of life with standardized activities (AQLQS) questionnaire score, investigator-assessed symptoms, exacerbations, and oral corticosteroid-treated exacerbations.
Results
Daily asthma symptoms, albuterol use, peak expiratory flow, FEV1, FVC, and investigator-assessed asthma symptoms at 24 weeks did not improve significantly with lansoprazole treatment compared to placebo. The AQLQS emotional function domain improved at 24 weeks (p = 0.025) with lansoprazole therapy. Fewer patients receiving lansoprazole (8.1% vs 20.4%, respectively; p = 0.017) had exacerbations and oral corticosteroid-treated (ie, moderate-to-severe) exacerbations (4% vs 13.9%, respectively; p = 0.016) of asthma. A post hoc subgroup analysis revealed that fewer patients receiving one or more long-term asthma-control medications in addition to an ICS experienced exacerbations (6.5% vs 24.6%, respectively; p = 0.016) and moderate-to-severe exacerbations (2.2% vs 17.5%, respectively; p = 0.021) with lansoprazole therapy.
Conclusion
In adult patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma and symptoms of acid reflux, treatment with 30 mg of lansoprazole bid for 24 weeks did not improve asthma symptoms or pulmonary function, or reduce albuterol use. However, this dose significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and improved asthma quality of life, particularly in those patients receiving more than one asthma-control medication.}

The present study tested the hypothesis that both dysfunctional beliefs and EA uniquely predict BID even after accounting for general distress. A nonclinical female sample (N=100) completed measures of general distress, dysfunctional beliefs about appearance, EA, and BID in addition to providing in vivo anxiety ratings after looking at their most dissatisfactory facial feature in a vanity mirror. Linear regression analyses showed that dysfunctional beliefs, but not EA, accounted for significant unique variance in BID outcomes. Implications for understanding, assessing, and treating clinically significant BID are discussed.}

The retailer complements sponsored search bidding with dynamic pricing in a multi-period stochastic dynamic programming framework. Our analyses show that it is optimal for the retailer to invest heavily in bidding at low inventory levels, whereas at high levels of inventory he should use price promotions to enhance profits.

To analyze whether the developmental potential of the COCs bears a relation to morphological appearance, relative expression of a panel of genes associated with; (a) cumulus–oocyte interaction (Cx43, Cx37, GDF9 and BMP15), (b) fertilization (ZP2 and ZP3), (c) embryonic development (HSF1, ZAR1 and bFGF) and (d) apoptosis and survival (BAX, BID and BCL-XL, MCL-1, respectively) was studied at two stages: germinal vesicle (GV) stage and after in vitro maturation. The competence was further corroborated by evaluating the embryonic progression of the presumed zygotes obtained from fertilization of the graded COCs. The gene expression profile and development rate in pooled A and B grade (Group 1) COCs and pooled C and D grade (Group 2) COCs were determined and compared according to the original grades. The results of the study demonstrated that the morphologically characterized Group 2 COCs showed significantly (P<0.05) lower expression for most of the genes related to cumulus–oocyte interplay, fertilization and embryonic development, both at GV stage as well as after maturation. Group 1 COCs also showed greater expression of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL-XL and MCL1) both at GV stage and after maturation, while pro-apoptotic genes (BAX and BID) showed significantly (P<0.05) elevated expression in poor quality COCs at both the stages. The cleavage rate in Group 1 COCs was significantly higher than that of Group 2 (74.46±7.06 v. 31.57±5.32%). The development of the presumed zygotes in Group 2 oocytes proceeded up to 8- to 16-cell stages only, while in Group 1 it progressed up to morulae (35.38±7.11%) and blastocyst stages (9.70±3.15%), indicating their better developmental potential.}

The contractor may default due to these overruns, which affects the buyer’s expected cost. Here the lowest-bid auction emerges as the procurement mechanism that: (i) minimizes the expected transfers to the contractors, and (ii) requires the lowest surety bond to achieve a given probability of default. Since surety bonds are costly to post, the above makes a combination of the lowest-bid auction with the surety bond the optimal, i.e., the expected cost minimizing procurement mechanism in a wide range of parameters.}

We collect trade data including daily volume and bid–ask spread to assemble a unique data set at individual firm level from S&P 500 firms and analyze the firms’ bid–ask spread and volume before and after issuing the regulation. This natural experiment allows us to separate the effect of regulation from the effect of other confounding factors. The results from our panel data analyses indicate that bid–ask spread has decreased by about 5% in response to the new regulation. Our results are statistically significant and highly robust. We also examine the impact of the new regulation on a volume-based measure of liquidity, and find that the regulation is associated with greater volume, consistent with a reduction in information asymmetry. Moreover, this result holds mainly for firms that are high-tech, consistent with them being in greater need of this additional information disclosure channel.}

Existing benchmarks are ineffective in the tender evaluation task for three reasons. Firstly, these benchmarks are mostly based on the profit margins as the only key performance indicator (KPI) while there are other KPIs fit to drive the evaluation process. Secondly, these benchmarks don’t take project context into account, thereby restricts their predictive accuracy. And finally, these benchmarks are obtained from small subsets of data, making it hard to generalise. As a result, estimators cannot probe into tenders to judge the strengths and weaknesses of their bids. This advancement is critical for not only choosing more lucrative opportunities but also driving negotiations during the tendering process. This study aims to develop a benchmarking system for tender evaluation using Big Data of 1.2 terabytes, comprising 5.7 million cells. A holistic list of seventeen (17) KPIs is identified from the email data using Text Mining approaches. Besides, eight (8) key project attributes are chosen for ensuring context-aware benchmarking using Focused Group Interviews (FGIs). At the crux of this work lies the proposition of a deep ensemble learner based on the decomposition-integration methodology. In the decomposition stage, the model predicts several attribute-specific benchmarks for each KPI using our proposed context-aware algorithm. In the integration stage, deep neural network-based learners are trained to generate final project-sensitive KPI benchmark. The learner is deployed in the Spring tool to support the tender evaluation of power infrastructure projects. A tender of 60km underground cabling project is evaluated using the proposed learner. The system spontaneously identified KPIs in the tender that require further attention to achieve greater profitability performance.}

When a BID is approved by a majority of property owners in a neighborhood, state law makes contributions to the BID budget mandatory. This resolution of the neighborhood's collective action problem reduces crime — BIDs in the city of Los Angeles are robustly associated with crime declines of 6 to 10%. Indeed, crime falls regardless of estimation technique: fixed effects; comparing BIDs to neighborhoods that considered, but did not adopt, BIDs; using propensity score matching; and comparing BIDs to their neighbors. Strikingly, these declines are purchased cheaply. Attributing all BID expenditure to violent crime reduction, and thus ignoring the impact of BID expenditure on many quality-of-life crimes, BIDs spend $21,000 to avert one violent crime. This higher bound estimate is substantially lower than the $57,000 social cost of a violent crime.}

In contrast to our hypothesis, results show that stricter takeover law does not hurt bidders. Its effect on target announcement returns is significantly positive and economically large. Our findings on individual provisions suggest that the mandatory bid rule and ownership disclosure increase overall synergistic gains in takeovers, while the fair-price rule and squeeze-out rights may reduce them. Further results show that stricter takeover regulation increases competition in the market for corporate control and reduces the time to successful completion of a takeover bid, which explains increased combined wealth gains under stricter takeover regulation.}

abstract = {Background
Body image dissatisfaction (BID) is pervasive among patients presenting for bariatric surgery but improves significantly postoperatively. These findings have been determined primarily from studies of adults. The objective of the present study was to examine the changes in BID among adolescents with extreme obesity from baseline/preoperatively to 6 and 12 months after receiving bariatric surgery at a pediatric medical center using body size estimation.
Methods
BID was prospectively assessed among 16 adolescent bariatric patients (mean age 16.3 ± 1.2 years, mean body mass index [BMI] 66.2 ± 12.0, 67% female) using a standard visual/perceptual measure (i.e., Stunkard Figure Rating Scale). Participants identified their current and ideal body size, with a discrepancy score (current minus ideal) indicating BID. The body size estimation ratings were compared with attitudinal (i.e., Impact of Weight on Quality Of Life–Kids: Body Esteem and Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents: Physical Appearance) body image scores, BMI, and total weight-related quality of life.
Results
A significant reduction occurred in the current body size (from 7.9 to 6.4, P <.001) from baseline to 6 months but not from 6 to 12 months. The current body size was related to BMI and percentage of excess weight loss but not attitudinal body image at each follow-up point. A smaller discrepancy (current minus ideal) was associated with greater total weight-related quality of life (r = −.68), with a trend toward significance for body esteem (r = −.65) at 12 months.
Conclusion
Adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery experience a significantly decreased BID within the first 12 months after surgery, with the most substantial change occurring from baseline to 6 months. The postoperative weight-related quality of life is more closely associated with the body size discrepancy than with the current body size.}

A neural network based prediction model was developed and presented in this paper. Project data for the study were obtained from the Hong Kong Housing Department. Information from the tender reports was used as input variables and performance records of the successful bidder during construction were used as output variables. It was found that the networks for the prediction of performance scores for Works gave the highest hit rate. In addition, the two most sensitive input variables toward such prediction are “Difference between Estimate” and “Difference between the next closest bid”. Both input variables are price related, thus suggesting the importance of tender sufficiency for the assurance of quality production.}

Additionally, these deals result in reductions in borrowing costs, and are associated with lower investment bank advisory fees. However, the effect of having a common lender is asymmetric: the effect is positive for bidders, but not for targets, with the average target also receiving a lower acquisition premium. The results are robust to controlling for several lender characteristics and are not driven by lenders acting as advisors. Overall, we find that bank lenders serve an important role in M&A transactions, but their role may not be entirely bias-free.}

This bidding optimization strategy consists of a decentralized approach based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, where aggregators negotiate with the distribution system operator to obtain network-constrained energy and secondary reserve bids. For a case study of 2 aggregators and 1 distribution system operator, the results show that the network-constrained bidding strategy computes cost-effective and network-feasible energy and secondary reserve bids, as opposed to a network-free bidding strategy. In addition, the network-constrained bidding strategy preserves the independent roles of aggregators and the distribution system operator, and the data privacy of all agents.}

Here, overconfidence might lead to misperceptions of the bidder’s own cost situation, and of the probability of winning. We also study interactions of overconfidence with other psychometric properties of the bidder, and the format of information presentation. Both factors could mitigate the impact of overconfidence. Our results indicate that overconfidence leads to a more optimistic view of winning the auction and to more aggressive bidding. Its effect can be mitigated if bidders have a high risk literacy, but possibilities to influence it by better information representation are limited.}

This study uses two panel regression models to analyze a data set that covers 6888 tenders for these items between 2001 and 2006, which spans 2004, the year when use of the Chilecompra electronic platform becomes obligatory. Model 1 explains the winning bid in each tender relative to the historic price, whereas Model 2 explains the winning bid relative to the concurrent price paid by drugstore chains. The regressors include variables which in the theoretical literature are indirectly associated with purchase prices (tender volume, the number of bidders and the time between tenders) and a Chilecompra dummy variable which captures the direct effect of the platform. The novel hypothesis of this paper is that e-tendering engages the market mechanism more effectively than traditional tendering, because of reduced corruption and less supplier collusion, which results in a direct platform effect. The empirical results support the volume effect. Greater aggregation of purchases leads to 2.8% lower prices. The evidence does not support the other indirect channels. More bidders result in lower prices, but the number of bidders fails to increase after Chilecompra. More frequent tendering leads to lower prices for medical devices, but tender frequency decreases after the implementation of the platform. Finally, the empirical results confirm the direct platform effect. Electronic tendering over Chilecompra leads directly to a greater than 8% reduction in prices. These results contribute to the literature on the returns to IT investments.}

A study with market data from the Iberian electricity market is used for comparison and validation of the forecasting and optimization performance of the global and divided optimization approaches. The results show that evaluating the forecast quality separately from its impact in the optimization results is misleading, because a forecast with a low error might result in a higher cost than a forecast with higher error. Both bidding approaches were also compared with an inflexible EV load approach where the EV are not controlled by an aggregator and start charging when they plug-in. Results show that optimized bids allow a considerable cost reduction when compared to an inflexible load approach, and the computational performance of the algorithms satisfies the requirements for operational use by a future real EV aggregation agent.}

Providing monetary rewards is an effective way to encourage smart phone users to contribute good quality data. However, the cost for long-term data collection in a wide area could be unaffordable for a MCS requester. In this paper, we enable data requesters to recruit sensing workers in a group buying way. Requesters with similar data demand can form a group to share the payment, which significantly reduces the cost. Each group has an agent, which represents all group members to compete in recruiting sensing workers. In this paper, we propose a group buying based auction mechanism for MCS, which consists of two phases. In the first phase, requesters submit their demands of sensing data and bids to their group agent, the group agent decides the winners of this group and the affordable payment collected from the winners. In the second phase, group agents attend the auction for recruiting sensing workers. If a group agent wins a worker, his group members pay the worker and obtain the demanding data. Two algorithms are proposed for each phase of TGBA. We have proved that TGBA is computationally efficient and possesses good economic properties such as individual rationality, budget balance and truthfulness, no matter whichever algorithm is chosen for the two phases. Extensive simulations are conducted, which show our proposed algorithms achieve better performance than the baseline mechanism without group buying.}

It is well known that stock bids are received more negatively than cash bids, so we further partition the sample of acquirers by consideration type and examine the abnormal returns of each partition.

abstract = {Background
Apixaban (5 mg BID), dabigatran (available as 150 mg and 110 mg BID in Europe), and rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) are 3 novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) currently approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
Objective
The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban against other NOACs from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Services.
Methods
A Markov model was developed to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic impact of apixaban versus other NOACs over a lifetime. Pair-wise indirect treatment comparisons were conducted against other NOACs by using ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation), RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy), and ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) trial results for the following end points: ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeds, myocardial infarction, and treatment discontinuations. Outcomes were life-years, quality-adjusted life years gained, direct health care costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
Results
Apixaban was projected to increase life expectancy versus other NOACs, including dabigatran (both doses) and rivaroxaban. A small increase in therapeutic management costs was observed with apixaban due to projected gains in life expectancy and lower discontinuation rates anticipated on apixaban versus other NOACs through lifetime. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £9611, £4497, and £5305 per quality-adjusted life-year gained with apixaban compared with dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust over a wide range of inputs.
Conclusions
Although our analysis was limited by the absence of head-to-head trials, based on the indirect comparison data available, our model projects that apixaban may be a cost-effective alternative to dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for stroke prevention in AF patients from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Services.}

abstract = {Background
Currently, there is no established universal standard of care for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) in orthopedic patients undergoing revision total hip arthroplasty (rTHA). The aim of this study is to determine whether a protocol of 81-mg aspirin (ASA) bis in die (BID) is safe and/or effective in preventing VTE in patients undergoing rTHAs vs 325-mg ASA BID.
Methods
In 2017, a large academic medical center adopted a new protocol for VTE prophylaxis in arthroplasty patients at standard risk. Initially, patients received 325-mg ASA BID but switched to 81-mg ASA BID. A retrospective review (2011-2019) was performed to identify 1361 consecutive rTHA patients and their associated 90-day postoperative complications such as VTE, including pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), as the primary outcome; and gastrointestinal and wound bleeding, acute periprosthetic joint infection, and mortality as the secondary outcome.
Results
From 2011 to 2017, 973 rTHAs were performed and 13 total VTE cases were diagnosed (1.34%). From 2017 to 2019, 388 rTHAs were performed with 3 total VTE cases identified (0.77%). Chi-squared analyses and logistic regression models showed no differences in rates or odds in postoperative PE (P = .09), DVT (P = .79), PE and DVT (P = .85), and total VTE (P = .38) using either dose. There were also no differences between bleeding complications (P = .14), infection rate (P = .46), and mortality (P = .53).
Conclusion
Using a protocol of 81-mg of ASA BID is noninferior to 325-mg ASA BID and may be safe and effective in maintaining low rates of VTE in patients undergoing rTHA.}

Unfortunately, three important problems still impede the application of EM in BID: the undesirable saddle points and local minima caused by highly nonconvex priors, the instability around zero of some of the most interesting sparsity promoting priors, and the intrinsic high computational cost of the corresponding BID algorithm. In this paper we first show how Super Gaussian priors can be made numerically tractable around zero by introducing the family of Huber Super Gaussian priors and then present a fast EM based blind deconvolution method formulated in the image space. In the proposed computational approach, image and kernel estimation are performed by using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which allows to exploit the advantages of FFT computation. For highly nonconvex priors, we propose a Smooth ADMM (SADMM) approach to avoid poor BID estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BID methods in terms of quality of the reconstructions and speed.}

According to European directives, when tenders are awarded through the “Most Economically Advantageous Tender” (MEAT) criterion, the awarding committee has to decide the tender evaluation criteria of the presented bids in advance. The authors propose a decision making tool that is aimed at helping the awarding committee in this difficult task and, at the same time, maintaining a transparent procedure in accordance with governmental procurement regulations and requirements as well as guaranteeing fair and equal evaluation of all bids. In this regard, the decision problem of supplier selection is addressed by applying an extension of the DEA (data envelopment analysis) methodology. The cross-efficiency evaluation is used for selecting the best supplier among the eligible candidates. The proposed technique allows the evaluation of quantitative data related to vendor selection and keeps the transparency features requested by public procurement. In addition, all bids are equally assessed according to the same objectively defined weights without any subjective setting by the public officers. The effectiveness and efficiency of the approach is supported by a case study that pertains to the tender of an Italian public agency.}

We find that the bidder with only public information makes no profit at equilibrium, while the bidder with private information generally makes positive profits. Moreover, the informed bidder's profits rise when he gathers extra information, and the increase in greater when the information is collected overtly than when it is collected covertly. When the uniformed bidder can observe some of the better-informed bidder's information, he prefers to make his observations covertly. If the seller has access to some of the better-informed bidder's information, or if he has affiliated information of his own, he can raise the expected price by adopting a policy of making that information public. However, there are cases where a policy of publicizing his information would lower the expected price. The distinguishing feature of these latter cases seems to be that the seller's information is complementary to the information of the better-informed bidder.}
