Our algorithm is highly parameterizable, which allows it to fit to the characteristics of the data set, and scale towards the available hardware resources.

Recently, novel columnar DBMSs have shown to provide orders of magnitude improvement in SQL query processing speed, preserving the parallel speedup of row-based parallel DBMSs. With that motivation in mind, we present COLUMNAR, a system integrating a parallel columnar DBMS and R, that can directly compute models on large data sets stored as relational tables. Our algorithms are based on a combination of SQL queries, user-defined functions (UDFs) and R calls, where SQL queries and UDFs compute data set summaries that are sent to R to compute models in RAM. Since our hybrid algorithms exploit the DBMS for the most demanding computations involving the data set, they show linear scalability and are highly parallel. Our algorithms generally require one pass on the data set or a few passes otherwise (i.e. fewer passes than traditional methods). Our system can analyze data sets faster than R even when they fit in RAM and it also eliminates memory limitations in R when data sets exceed RAM size. On the other hand, it is an order of magnitude faster than Spark (a prominent Hadoop system) and a traditional row-based DBMS.}, location = {Cartagena, Columbia}, series = {CCGRID '16}, pages = {627\u2013630}, numpages = {4}}

While traditional relational databases represent now only a small fraction of the database systems landscape, most database courses that cover SQL consider only the use of SQL in the context of traditional relational systems.

Can this trend of strategic transformation breaks through the innovation bottlenecks of high-tech SMEs, thereby provides more opportunities for improving their innovation performance? This article applies the method of internet big data to construct the indicator of digital strategic transformation, and uses the micro-data of China's new third board listed companies to study the impact of digital strategic transformation on the innovation performance of high-tech SMEs. The empirical result shows that the digital strategic transformation can significantly helps to promote the innovation performance of high-tech SMEs. To overcome the measurement errors of endogenous problems or missing variables in empirical model, a series of robustness tests are conducted. The results are still valid after replacing enterprise innovation indicators, and using different regression models. Based on this, the construction of digital infrastructure should play a more active role in the process of data management and knowledge innovation of high-tech SMEs.}, location = {Sanya, China}, series = {EBEE 2021}, pages = {62\u201366}, numpages = {5}}

Combined with the basic knowledge of big data, systematic research on the analysis of industrial economy information will contribute to the application practice of industrial big data. As a prediction model in machine learning, decision tree is widely used in various fields because its output results are easy to understand and explain. In the future, making full use of the value of big data will promote revolutionary changes in the work of the production and marketing departments. And put forward a decision tree classification algorithm in big data environment, which is mainly used to analyze Industrial Economy information.

Data of high dimension significantly increases the memory storage requirements and computational costs for data analytics. Therefore, reducing dimension can mainly improve three data mining performance: speed of learning, predictive accuracy and simplicity and comprehensibility of mined result. Feature selection, data preprocessing technique, is effective and efficient in data mining, data analytics and machine learning problems particularly in high dimension reduction. Most feature selection algorithms can eliminate only irrelevant features but redundant features. Not only irrelevant features but also redundant features can degrade learning performance. Mutual information measured feature selection is proposed in this work to remove both irrelevant and redundant features.}, location = {Ha Noi, Viet Nam}, series = {MLMI2018}, pages = {3\u20137}, numpages = {5}, keywords = {Feature Selection, Redundant Features, High Dimensional Data, Mutual Information}}
