We focus on two phases of analysts' work: discovery, where the field definitions are understood, and profiling, where assumptions are tested by searching, observing, and running counts on data. Lack of data exploration and understanding can lead to faulty assumptions and misinterpretation. In practice, analysts use SQL queries and scripts to subset big data, reducing it for visualization or spreadsheet pivots. However, due to large-size and high-dimensional data, it is challenging to determine precise subsets of interest without thorough data exploration and discovery. We reduce the cost of previewing subsets by combining search with an information rich visualization of high-dimensional data. To enable discovery and profiling, Quarry supports (1) rapid query generation and visualized search; and (2) defining and previewing subsets of data for potential export for further processing.

Big Data is of widespread societal importance and holds increasing implications for the computer science workforce. It also has appeal as a focus for middle school computer science because of its rich interplay with other important computer science principles. This paper examines three key aspects of a Big Data unit for middle school: its alignment with emerging curricular standards; the perspectives of middle school classroom teachers in mathematics, science, and language arts; and student feedback as explored during a middle school pilot study with a small subset of the planned curriculum.

In this paper, we propose a security pattern to improve traceability and veracity of data through the use of Blockchain technologies. In this pattern, Blockchain will be used as a distributed ledger where all operations performed on the data will be registered. Therefore, the veracity of the data will increase, as will the confidence in the insights obtained from the analysis.

With the rapid growth of the Internet and new media, ethnic dance has inevitably entered the \"BD era\" as a manifestation of traditional culture. Way, folk dance has always played an important role, and its unique performance and ethnic style stimulate people's senses to give it artistic charm. Due to the continuous acceleration of the overall reform process in our country, national dances are also faced with the task of how to advance with the times, and scientific training is a breakthrough in this issue. This article aims to study the application of BD research methods in the field of national dance scientific training. This article uses case study methods, literature research methods, survey methods, mathematical statistical analysis methods, etc. to explore how BD can provide scientific training methods for ethnic dance, and combine the research results of previous experts or scholars to further explore ethnic dance under BD thinking. The scientific training path forms a relatively comprehensive understanding. Then through the sorting and analysis of various national dance technique materials, combining with practice and theory, put forward the content of scientific training, and then summarize the solutions to the difficulties faced by national dance training under the BD thinking. Experiments show that there are not many folk dance educators who know BD well, only 27%, but most teachers and students still have a certain understanding of BD, and believe that BD can make folk dance training methods more scientific or It has an auxiliary effect on the training methods of national dance.}, location = {Dalian, China}, series = {ICISCAE 2021}, pages = {920\u2013923}, numpages = {4}}

Among them, \"flipped classroom\", an innovative teaching model that combines computer networks and teaching, has to be amazing. Judging from the schools that have tried this teaching model, the positive effect of this model is still very obvious. Not only does it increase the enthusiasm of students in class, gain more knowledge and apply the learned knowledge to life according to the situation, but also allows more interaction between teachers and students throughout the teaching process, and the teaching effect is more significant.

Hence, data mining techniques are becoming an essential tool for real-world cyber security applications. For example, a report from Gartner [gartner12] claims that \"Information security is becoming a big data analytics problem, where massive amounts of data will be correlated, analyzed and mined for meaningful patterns\". Of course, data mining/analytics is a means to an end where the ultimate goal is to provide cyber security analysts with prioritized actionable insights derived from big data. This raises the question, can we directly apply existing techniques to cyber security applications? One of the most important differences between data mining for cyber security and many other data mining applications is the existence of malicious adversaries that continuously adapt their behavior to hide their actions and to make the data mining models ineffective. Unfortunately, traditional data mining techniques are insufficient to handle such adversarial problems directly. The adversaries adapt to the data miner's reactions, and data mining algorithms constructed based on a training dataset degrades quickly. To address these concerns, over the last couple of years new and novel data mining techniques which is more resilient to such adversarial behavior are being developed in machine learning and data mining community. We believe that lessons learned as a part of this research direction would be beneficial for cyber security researchers who are increasingly applying machine learning and data mining techniques in practice.To give an overview of recent developments in adversarial data mining, in this three hour long tutorial, we introduce the foundations, the techniques, and the applications of adversarial data mining to cyber security applications. We first introduce various approaches proposed in the past to defend against active adversaries, such as a minimax approach to minimize the worst case error through a zero-sum game. We then discuss a game theoretic framework to model the sequential actions of the adversary and the data miner, while both parties try to maximize their utilities. We also introduce a modified support vector machine method and a relevance vector machine method to defend against active adversaries. Intrusion detection and malware detection are two important application areas for adversarial data mining models that will be discussed in details during the tutorial. Finally, we discuss some practical guidelines on how to use adversarial data mining ideas in generic cyber security applications and how to leverage existing big data management tools for building data mining algorithms for cyber security.}, location = {Vienna, Austria}, series = {CCS '16}, pages = {1866\u20131867}, numpages = {2}, keywords = {big data analytics for cyber security, adversarial data mining}}

Recently, venue recommendation is becoming an increasingly important research task due to the unprecedented number of publication venues. However, traditional methods focus on either the author\u2019s local network or author-venue similarity, where the multiple relationships between scholars and venues are overlooked, especially the venue\u2013venue interaction. To solve this problem, we propose an author topic model\u2013enhanced joint graph modeling approach that consists of venue topic modeling, venue-specific topic influence modeling, and scholar preference modeling. We first model the venue topic with Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Then, we model the venue-specific topic influence in an asymmetric and low-dimensional way by considering the topic similarity between venues, the top-influence of venues, and the top-susceptibility of venues. The top-influence characterizes venues\u2019 capacity of exerting topic influence on other venues. The top-susceptibility captures venues\u2019 propensity of being topically influenced by other venues. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that our proposed joint graph modeling approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}, pages = {1\u201315}, numpages = {15}, keywords = {Network embedding, academic information retrieval, natural language processing, scientific collaboration}}

Due to increasing data in volume, it needs performance optimization mechanism that requires management of JVM heap space. To Manage JVM heap space it needs management of garbage collector pause time that affects application performance. There are different parameters to pass to spark to control JVM heap space and GC time overhead to increase application performance. Passing appropriate heap size with appropriate types of GC as a parameter is one of performance optimization which is known as Spark Garbage collection tuning. To reduce GC overhead, an experiment was done by adjusting certain parameters for loading and dataframe creation and data retrieval process. The result shows 3.23% improvement in Latency and 1.62% improvement in Throughput as compared to default parameter configuration in garbage collection tuning approach.}, location = {Luoyang, China}, series = {ICNCC 2019}, pages = {75\u201378}, numpages = {4}, keywords = {Garbage Collection Tuning, HeapRegionSize, GC Events, JVM heap space}}

This century, it is about mining vast data sets of past user behaviors, simple algorithms, and using those to correct mistakes. The large Internet giants are data-driven enterprises that use data to transform and continually improve user experiences. In this talk, Hugh Williams shares stories about data and how it is used to build Internet products, and explains why he believes data will transform businesses as we know them. Every major company is becoming a data-driven company, and Hugh shares examples of transformations occurring in health, aviation, farming, and telecommunications. He recently joined Pivotal, a company that is assembling the toolkit that exists in only a few consumer Internet companies, and making that toolkit open and available to every industry, including big data platforms, development frameworks, and an open, cloud-independent Platform-as-a-Service.

Through the questionnaire survey and interview in colleges and universities, this paper points out that the MH education of college students is still bound by experiential intuitive inertia thinking, unable to meet the needs, homogenized content, and unidirectional defects. There are technical means can not support, as well as the lack of educator personality and the lack of educatee personality. The questionnaire was distributed to 1200 college students by secret sampling, and 1150 questionnaires were effectively recovered, and the recovery rate was nearly 95. As a new symbol of the information age, there is no doubt that the huge economic and social value contained in the massive data, the transformation of the era opened by BD(BD), and the fact that it caused the change can not be avoided. BD is not only a technology, but also a value and methodology. It has brought methodological changes to college students' MH education, and also provides a possibility to improve their working methods, methods and means. The significance of individualized MH education for college students in the era of BD is to scientifically judge the MH state and behavior characteristics of students through the integration, mining and analysis of massive data, so as to formulate and adopt targeted MH education means and methods according to the students' individual reality. Through the analysis of the application cases of BD in MH education of college students, it is necessary and feasible to promote individualized MH education of college students by using BD.}, location = {Dalian, China}, series = {ICISCAE 2021}, pages = {978\u2013982}, numpages = {5}}

This research is based on current scholars' theoretical foundation and practical application research on education big data and the integration of intra- and extra-curricular models, and constructs a framework of intra- and extra-curricular integration based on the big data environment. Combining the characteristics of university physical education and students' learning characteristics, we construct an integrated teaching model in and out of class under the big data environment to guide the integrated teaching practice in and out of class. Through experiments and empirical demonstrations conducted by the \"in-class and extra-curricular integration\" teaching model, the teaching effect shows that the college physical education model has a positive effect in improving students' interest in learning, improving learning effects, and cultivating students' college sports habits. Extracurricular sports clubs better match the teaching content in class, so that the teaching content is well supplemented. The organic connection between the two is more conducive to the improvement of students' skill level. At the same time, this also promotes the development of campus culture and community culture.}, location = {Ottawa, ON, Canada}, series = {CIPAE 2021}, pages = {1152\u20131156}, numpages = {5}, keywords = {teaching mode, Big data environment, college sports, integration of inside and outside classes}}
