Today, big data has relevant applications in the industry due to improvements in the system performance and by turning information into knowledge. Big data challenges include the lack of strategies to process computational cost and the large amount of data when computing machine learning predictions. To overcome these scalability issues, it is convenient to work with distributed and parallelized architecture across multiple nodes. The approach is based on Apache Spark, an in-memory distributed application that offers extensive machine learning libraries. The main contribution of the study is to measure the scalability by calculating the execution time that a classifier achieves with larger workloads. We validate our classifier models with experiments on logistic regression and random forest by studying their adaptability to the Apache Spark framework. The present work expects to combine the areas of big data and machine learning on scalability, and the use of optimization methods, cache and persist.

There are a variety of non-relational data stores (databases) available. These data stores and big data can be used in combination to work with. Attributes of these databases are available for companies where big data is used.

Automatic bone age evaluation is an example of the implementation of this technology in the medical field. The automated assessment is done based on the left-hand X-ray images. This assessment helps the radiologist and pediatrician evaluate children's growth. A system that can generate a precise and reliable prediction is essential. Thus the main challenge is to determine the suitable technology that can generate a reliable forecast, mainly when working with a large quantity of data. Big data is a growing trend; practical computing challenges created by data streams can be found in several types of applications. It is known that data streams are usually obtained from sensors and monitors which accumulatively can make data very large in volume. This can result in the inability of real-time processing to be carried out. In this paper, the data stream technique is utilized to assess and predict bone ages. The analysis process is carried out in real-time when the data arrives so that the process of storing new data is done after the data is analyzed. A 9 GB sized-dataset consisting of 12,611 images were used. The images have various resolutions. We extracted and analyzed image features by using Canny Edge feature extraction. To predict bone age from those extracted features, we enhance the data stream mining technique base on tree stream mining. We use MAE or Mean Absolute Error, RMSE or Root Mean Squared Error, and MAPE or Mean Absolute Percentage Error as metrics in this measurement. The outcomes of our experiment show that our approach in data stream mining can increase performance measurements. The MAPE of our approach gives a 7% lower error evaluation compared to the standard method.}, location = {Cergy-Pontoise, France}, series = {ICBDR 2019}, pages = {119\u2013123}, numpages = {5}, keywords = {FIMT-DD, Bone Age, Data Stream Mining, Big Data, Decision Support System}}

While many data-level and algorithm-level methods exist for treating label noise, the challenges associated with big data call for new and improved methods. This survey addresses these concerns by providing an extensive literature review on treating label noise within big data. We begin with an introduction to the class label noise problem and traditional methods for treating label noise. Next, we present 30 methods for treating class label noise in a range of big data contexts, i.e. high volume, high variety, and high velocity problems. The surveyed works include distributed solutions capable of operating on data sets of arbitrary sizes, deep learning techniques for large-scale data sets with limited clean labels, and streaming techniques for detecting class noise in the presence of concept drift. Common trends and best practices are identified in each of these areas, implementation details are reviewed, empirical results are compared across studies when applicable, and references to 17 open-source projects and programming packages are provided. An emphasis on label noise challenges, solutions, and empirical results as they relate to big data distinguishes this work as a unique contribution that will inspire future research and guide machine learning practitioners.}, keywords = {machine learning, label noise, data quality, deep learning, data streams, classification, big data}}

In this study, we change the feed system for the Label Propagation algorithm from a random method to a degree-based system. In addition, we introduce a new convergence method that checks the membership for every node and flags them as converged when they meet the requirement. The main contributions of this work are twofold: (i) we optimize the Label Propagation algorithm, improving the accuracy by a factor of two. The results depend on the complexity of the graph; i.e. the denser a graph structure is, the better result the algorithm will achieve.

Their analysis may include a range of tasks to be executed on a range of query engines. The tasks, as a whole, represent the rationale of a specific process. The users that create such a process may have various roles, like, business analysts, engineers, end-users etc. Each role may need or care for a different level of abstraction with respect to the execution of the individual tasks and overall process. Therefore, it is necessary to enable the expression of analytics tasks in an abstract manner, adaptable to the user role, interest and expertise. We propose a framework for the expression and preparation for execution of complex processes that perform analytics on Big Data. The framework enables the expression of such processes in the form of workflows and prepares such workflows for execution by determining and clarifying execution semantics of individual tasks, and by manipulating the workflow in order to create an equivalent workflow that will be optimally executed alone or together with other workflows.}, location = {Yokohama, Japan}, series = {C3S2E '15}, pages = {125\u2013132}, numpages = {8}, keywords = {Workflow Management, Data Analytics, Big Data}}

However, how well such application can support and effect managerial decision making still remains a challenge. From a case study of a traditional business in adopting new technology, it was found that an underlying issue that impeded effective and efficient managerial decision making lied in the human computer interaction process, and the design of the system user interface can be the culprit. With the rise of big data revolution, it seems that this underlying issue has still not been resolved for the applications to best support the executive users. This paper therefore shares research findings and developments in the social media and human language technology, and suggests employing adaptive user interfaces for big data applications to better support managerial decision making.}, location = {Seoul, Republic of Korea}, series = {ICEC '15}, pages = {1\u20133}, numpages = {3}, keywords = {decision support systems, human behavior analysis, management, adaptive user interface design, big data, information systems, Managerial decision making, personality, human computer interaction}}

And in today's world of sensors and internet-enabled devices, smartphones and wearables, this is no longer just limited to our online activities. Exercising in the park, shopping for groceries, falling asleep, or even taking a shower, are just some of the everyday real-world activities that are likely to generate data. This is the big data world of the so-called Sensor Web. It is enabled by the widescale availability of high-performance computing, always-on communications, and mobile computing devices that come equipped with a variety of powerful sensors. This provides for a powerful computing and sensing ecosystem with important applications across all aspects of how we live, work, and play.The primary challenge for us now is to understand how we can (and whether we should) use this information. On the one hand, the promise of big data analytics is better decisions: better decisions about where we might live or where to send our kids to school; better decisions about the food we eat and the exercise we should take; and better decisions about some of the biggest choices facing modern societies when it comes to health, education, energy, and climate. On the other hand, this potential has a darker side, in the form of a gradual erosion of personal privacy as businesses and even governments seek to exploit our personal data for their own purposes, often without our informed consent.What is certain is that the combination of mobile computation, cheap but powerful sensors, and big data analytics points to new ways of thinking about some of society's toughest challenges. But to take advantage of these benefits we must reconcile the promise of big data with the pitfalls of privacy. Only then can these technologies can have a meaningful impact on how we can all benefit from the big data revolution as part of a healthier, safer, fairer world.}, location = {Guzelyurt, Northern Cyprus}, series = {HT '15}, pages = {101}, numpages = {1}, keywords = {sensor web, data analytics, mobile computing, big data}}
